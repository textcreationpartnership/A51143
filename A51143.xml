            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>OF all the Products of human Wit, whereof the Brain aſſiſted by the Hand is capable, there are none ſo admirable and excellent, as the Arts which relate to Deſigning.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> were of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. They placed them among the Liberal Arts, and ſet ſo great a value on them, that their Slaves were forbidden to learn either Painting, Sculpture, or Architecture. There were only Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen permitted the Honour to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them: And even Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves gloried in the Practice of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> who endeavoured to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Grecians</hi> in the Perfection of
<pb facs="tcp:55267:4"/>theſe Arts, had the ſame Eſteem for them; for ſeveral Conſuls and Emperors took pleaſure in employing themſelves therein. And theſe Arts kept up their Excellency, while the Empire was in its heighth; but they began to decline when that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Prey of ſeveral Tyrants who were the Cauſe of its Ruine. Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture underwent the like Deſtiny, for they loſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Eſteem they found under the firſt Emperors, and at length fell into that ill and rude Manner, which has been ſince named Gothick or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous. But afterwards they regain'd new life and vigour under the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeveral Princes, and Republicks, and by the Induſtry and Application of thoſe ingenious Men who ſtudied them.</p>
            <p>It has not been without juſt Reaſons that theſe Three illuſtrious Profeſſions have always been valued and eſteemed at ſo high a rate, for their Beauties are always extremely pleaſing to the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb facs="tcp:55267:4"/>and there is nothing which more illuſtrates the Glory of Princes, than the Productions of Deſigning. In ſhort, the famous Structures of the <hi>Egyptians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> eternize the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe Illuſtrious Perſons for whoſe Glory they were raiſed: They are alſo inconteſtable Witneſſes of the Victories which their Great Captains obtain'd over other Nations.</p>
            <p>Such clear evidences are more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick than any Hiſtories, for they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us without any prejudice the Truth of thoſe Things, for which thoſe ancient Buildings were raiſed by the Art of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning: It was moreover by means of this Art that Medals were made, which ſerve to confirm ſome very doubtful Matters of Fact related by Hiſtory: And expreſs to us the Actions of Heroes, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Memory to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>To theſe advantages may be added that of Military Architecture, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its Principles from this Art, and which is very neceſſary for the Security
<pb facs="tcp:55267:5"/>of Towns, and Defence of Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Nor have the Arts of Deſigning been of leſs advantage to Princes in the Point of Religion, than for the Defence of their States. The Heathens were very Curious in, and made it a conſiderable Part of, their Religious Worſhip to diſtinguiſh the Forms they made their Temples of, according to the different Divinities they therein worſhipp'd. Since that time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe Temples have been made uſe of
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">At <hi>Rome</hi> ſeveral of the Popes by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Emperors of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> converted ſeveral of the Heathen Temples into Chriſtian Churches, as that of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> which is now the Church of <hi>Notre-Dame de la Rotonde,</hi> and that of <hi>Romulus</hi> was dedicated to St. <hi>Coſmus</hi> and St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian;</hi> and alſo that of <hi>Bacchus</hi> which is at preſent called St. <hi>Eſtienne</hi> the round.</note> for the Worſhip of the true God. But thoſe that have been built on purpoſe for the Chriſtian Religion ſurpaſs thoſe ancient Temples: And this may be ſeen in ſeveral Places, and
<pb facs="tcp:55267:5"/>chiefly in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, at <hi>Rome,</hi> the nobleſt Church that was ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>The Churches are adorn'd with Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, with Baſs Reliefs, and Pictures to repreſent the Myſteries of our Religion, and the Martyrdoms of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Theſe Subjects managed by ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Painters, and Sculptors, make greater and more laſting Impreſſions upon the Minds of People, than Words can. This was the Opinion of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and ſeveral other Great Men, who were ſenſibly touched at the ſight of theſe Repreſentations.</p>
            <p>Moreover Nature, which conſtantly tends towards what is moſt agreeable to its ſelf, taught Men Deſigning before they had found out Characters to Write. This Truth is evident in the Hiſtorical Figures (or Hieroglyphicks) of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Engraven on Stone, as may be ſeen on their Obelisks. For thoſe Sorts of Letters are only the Deſigns of Figures made of ſome Parts of the Human Body, of Animals, of Plants,
<pb facs="tcp:55267:6"/>and of all ſorts of Inſtruments, which were called Hieroglyphicks, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this People made uſe before they had Letters.</p>

            <p>Upon this Cloath were repreſented the Veſſels, the Men, the Artillery, the Horſes, and the Dogs, whereof thoſe Recruits conſiſted.

               <pb facs="tcp:55267:8"/>And how afterwards they went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Progreſs they made in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Times of their Kings, of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and of the Emperors; <hi>laſtly,</hi> we ſhew in what Eſteem they were there, and how far Protected till their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</p>
            <p>In the Second Book, we treat of their Fall, and ſhew how the true Manner and Guſt of Deſigning began to decline at <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Commodus</hi> down to <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and afterwards, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture alſo decay'd: Inſomuch that an ill and rude Manner was introduced in Building, in Painting and Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Zeal of the Chriſtian Religion contributed very much to the Deſtruction of the ancient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Images, as did alſo the taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Reigns of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> who followed that rude Manner in <hi>Italy,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated it almoſt throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55267:9"/>
            <p>But the Magnificence of Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was maintained longer in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire than in other Places, and eſpecially at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by reaſon that the Firſt Emperors were very much addicted to Architecture, as we ſee in <hi>Conſtantius, Theodoſius,</hi> and in <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who Employed vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in Building, which for ſome time kept up Architecture, Sculpture and Painting: Theſe two laſt ſuffered very much, ſince the time of thoſe Princes, by the <hi>Iconoclaſtes,</hi> who deſtroy'd the Images, and barbarouſly perſecuted the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and at length theſe Arts fell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in that Empire, in the Reigns of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who ſuffer none to Deſign the human Figure, nor any thing that has life.</p>
            <p>In the Third Book, we ſhew that about the Year 1110, the Arts of Deſigning began to revive a little at <hi>Florence,</hi> and in ſome other Cities of <hi>Italy;</hi> the Protection they afterwards found under the Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:55267:9"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> the Republicks of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> the great Dukes of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and the Popes of that Illuſtrious Houſe, and ſeveral other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> gave means and opportunity to ſeveral excellent <hi>Genius's</hi> to apply themſelves with a great deal of Zeal to the Re-eſtabliſhment of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. In fine in the Year 1500 I conclude the Re-eſtabliſhment of theſe Arts, for it was in this happy Century that they were brought to Perfection by the Famous Deſigners who flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about that time.</p>
            <p>This has been acknowledged by all the Famous Deſigners of our Age: Who have eſteemed it their Glory to Imitate the Works of <hi>Raphael, Correggio, Julio Romano,</hi> and <hi>Titian,</hi> and ſeveral other Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men of the laſt Age.</p>
            <p>For it has been by means of this imitation that the true Way
<pb facs="tcp:55267:10"/>of Painting and Deſigning has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued down to us; as alſo the right Manner of Sculpture and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture: As has been practiſed from the beginning of this Century 1600. by the Famous <hi>Carraches,</hi> and afterwards by their Diſciples <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menichino, Albani, Guido, Lanfranc, Algradi.</hi> Afterwards the true Way and Manner was continued in theſe Three Arts at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Pouſſin, Francis du Queſnoy, Peter da Cortona</hi> and <hi>Bernini.</hi> As alſo in <hi>Flanders</hi> by <hi>Rubens</hi> and <hi>Van Dyck:</hi> Moreover <hi>France</hi> by <hi>de Broſſe, Le Mercier, Le Sueur, Sarrazin, Manſard, Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Le Brun Mignard,</hi> and ſeveral other great Men who have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Arts of Deſigning.</p>
            <p>But this true and regular Manner is kept up very ſucceſsfully at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by thoſe Ingenious Men who compoſe the Royal Academies of
<pb facs="tcp:55267:10"/>Painting, Sculpture and Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Having determin'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Footſteps of the Ingenious Ancients, and the incomparable Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of thoſe excellent Genius's who appear'd with ſo much Glory in the Age before them. We may perhaps hereafter preſent the Reader with a Continuation of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory throughout the Century 1600, which we reſerve for a Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
            <p>Nor ought it to ſurprize any, That a Painter ſhould undertake to write an Hiſtory of Deſigning, becauſe among other Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he ought to be Maſter of, that of being well verſed in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is none of the leaſt; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes his Works conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Truth, and can give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Repreſentations: And joining the Theory of his Art with the Practice, he becomes expert
<pb facs="tcp:55267:11"/>enough to compoſe a Syſtem of the Rules of it, far better than thoſe who are not Deſigners.</p>
            <p>This was practiſed by the moſt Famous Painters of Antiquity, as <hi>Apelles,</hi> and his Diſciple <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and
<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Aſclepiodorus, Protogenes, Euphranor,</hi> and <hi>Praxiteles</hi> writ of Painting and Sculpture, as did <hi>Argellius</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> of Architecture.</note> others: The Illuſtrious Moderns have alſo written of the Arts of Deſigning, as <hi>Leon Baptiſta Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> and ſeveral others
<note n="(h)" place="bottom">The chief of the Modern Painters who have writ of Painting ſince <hi>Leon Baptiſta Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti,</hi> and <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> are <hi>Vaſari, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menini, P. Lomazzo, F. Zucchero, Albert Dal Borgo San Sepolcro, Albert Durer, John Couſin, Charles Alphonſus du Freſnoy;</hi> and the chief of thoſe who have writ of Architecture beſides <hi>Leon Baptiſta Alberti</hi> are <hi>Vignola, Palladio, Scammozzi, Serlio, Barbaro, Cataneo, Philbert de Lorme, John Bullant,</hi> and <hi>du Cerceau.</hi>
               </note> who have treated learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb facs="tcp:55267:11"/>of theſe Arts for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe who deſign to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent therein.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why we have rather given this Treatiſe the Title of <hi>the Arts that relate to Deſigning</hi> than the Hiſtory of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, is becauſe Deſigning not only comprehends thoſe Three Parts, but alſo graving on Copper, cutting in Wood, and graving for Medals, and Damask-work, and Embroidery, and Inlaying and ſeveral other Works all depending on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon all theſe Arts are put together, and compoſe thoſe Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies, which are called in <hi>Italy,</hi> Academies of Deſigning, where Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Sculptors and Architects take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſucceſſively the firſt Places: And for this Reaſon they who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:55267:12"/>for any of theſe Profeſſions, firſt of all learn Deſigning, and then determine their Choice to ſome one in Particular, or ſometimes to more, being capable of ſucceeding therein, if they are firſt of all good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigners.</p>
            <p>This has been evident heretofore in <hi>Daedalus, Phidias Euphranor,</hi> and ſeveral others, who were as Excellent in Sculpture and Painting as in Architecture, and alſo of late in <hi>Ghiberto</hi> who was a Painter, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, Sculptor and Goldſmith: <hi>Verochio</hi> and <hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> were alſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all theſe Arts, as likewiſe <hi>Bramante, Raphael, Julio Romano, Baldaſſare, Vignola</hi> and <hi>Pirro Ligorio</hi> who were Painters and Architects: <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> was equally Excellent in Architecture, Sculpture and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for he was an Excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigner.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55267:12"/>
            <p>Hence it is, we have taken our Device on the Frontiſpeice of this Book, which expreſſes, that <hi>Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Parent of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.</hi> And now we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but expect that Criticks will be making Reflections on the Style we have uſed throughout this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But that the Reader may not ſtick or carp if he meets with any obſolete Terms or Words not much in uſe, and if the Turn of the Phraſe is not always ſo Nice as he might expect: He muſt know, that the Author's Deſign is only to make himſelf underſtood by thoſe who learn Deſigning. Wherefore he hopes that the unprejudiced Reader will not ſo nicely regard the Politeneſs of Expreſſion, ſince his Buſineſs is Painting, and he looks upon the reſt only as accidental Accompliſhments.</p>
            <p>If this Hiſtory find a favourable Acceptance, we deſign hereafter to
<pb facs="tcp:55267:13"/>give an Alphabetical Explication of the Terms moſt uſed in the Arts of Deſigning, whence ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations may be raiſed very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Inſtruction of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Lovers of theſe Arts.</p>

                  <p>Theſe fine Parts and Turns wherein the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the Arts conſiſts, began firſt of all to be loſt in Deſigning, which continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that reliſh of Art down from the time of the latter Empire, and of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> This is evident in his Triumphant Arch, by his Medals, his Statues in the Capitol, and the Images of Chriſt Jeſus

                  <p>THAT which contributed to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Art of Deſigning at <hi>Rome,</hi> was the removal of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to eſtabliſh the Empire at <hi>Bizantium:</hi> For he hired the beſt Artiſts in <hi>Rome,</hi> and carried away an infinite number of

                  <p>ONE would have thought that the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Deſigning ought to have kept up at <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon that from the beginning of the Chriſtian Religion, the Chriſtians made uſe of Painting and Sculpture to repreſent the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the old and new Teſtament, to adorn their Churches and Tombs. This is indeed True; but then, conſidering that theſe Paintings and Sculptures were only for the Inſtruction of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ſolitary and ſubterranean Places, where they celebrated Divine Service, they did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves with the Curioſities of Deſigning, nor giving their Pieces that nicety and beauty as thoſe did who lived under the firſt <hi>Caeſars;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that when the Chriſtians in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> had the liberty of erecting Temples

                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had no leſs eſteem for fine Buildings and the Arts of Deſigning, than his Father.

                  <p>We may alſo conclude that Painting kept up in its Excellency longer at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> than at <hi>Rome,</hi> for theſe two Arts have always been inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable both in their riſe and fall.

                  <p>THIS rude Way of Building continued du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the firſt and ſecond Race of our Kings, as is evident by the Churches <hi>Charlemain</hi> built in ſeveral Cities of his Empire which are all after the ſame Way.</p>
                  <p>This Great Emperor after having been Crown'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and regulated the publick and private Affairs of that City, and even thoſe of the Pope, and the Church as to temporal Affairs; he viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and left as a Teſtimony of his good Will to <hi>Florence,</hi> the Church of the Apoſtles which he there built, of a better and finer Order than thoſe that were built before the Reign of this glorious Prince, or the others that were made ſince the decay of Architecture, to the revival of the Arts of Deſigning: For the Bodies of the Pillars, the Capitels, and the Arches of the Church are done with a great deal of Grace and true Proportion: This Church has always been eſteemed by Architects to be of ſingular Beauty; and <hi>Ser-bruneleſchi</hi> one of the moſt famous Artiſts thought fit to take this Church for a Model of the Churches of the Holy Ghoſt, and St. <hi>Laurence</hi> at <hi>Florence</hi> which are of his Deſigning.</p>

                        <hi>Reflections on the Fall of the Arts of Deſigning, and on the</hi> Gothick <hi>Way.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE <hi>Gothick</hi> Way continued after <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> during the ſecond Race of our Kings, and under the Reigns of moſt part of the third; under theſe laſt Princes there was no Change, neither in Architecture nor Sculpture, which is the reaſon we ſee nothing well ordered in their Palaces: This is apparent in the Palace of King <hi>Robert</hi> at St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> Theſe Buildings have nothing but the <hi>Gothick</hi> Way in them. This method continued after this King: And is to be ſeen in <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> which his Succeſſors finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>All the Beauty of this Church conſiſts in its vaſt Greatneſs and fine Plane, and ingenious Cutting of the Stones, and ſome delicate ſmall Parts or Pieces of Architecture, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuſtain great Weights. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Orders of Architecture, and good Sculpture is there wanting; every thing is after the Antient <hi>Gothick</hi> Way, which was followed in <hi>France</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII.</p>
                  <p>By what has been ſaid in this Book, we may conclude, that the Arts of Deſign decay'd as ſoon as the Princes of the latter Empire grew out of love with them, and no longer protected them: This Neglect of them began the Ruine of theſe Arts, which encreaſed during the Civil Wars, by the ſackings of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the deſolation of the Provinces of its Empire. The Infidels and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55267:57"/>the Hereticks contributed much to this Misfortune in ſeveral Places, and that even to the total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of theſe illuſtrious Profeſſions.</p>
                  <p>But that the Reflections we make on the Fall of theſe Arts may be uſeful to thoſe who learn Deſigning, it will be neceſſary to know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts the ill and rude Way which was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the time of their Declenſion, that it may be avoided for the Future.</p>
                  <p>It may be remarked in the firſt Place in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Pieces, that what they had of Rude or Ill in them, proceeded from the Ignorance of thoſe that made them, in the juſt Proportions of the human Figure, which is the ſolid Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of juſt Deſigning; ſince all their Statues are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate. For the moſt Part have their Heads either too great or too little, the Hands and the extreme Parts too thin and ſlender, their Poſtures without any choiceneſs, nay without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or expreſſion. Alſo in the cloathing of their Figures, are to be ſeen Cloaths cut in Pleats and Folds where naturally there are none; in ſhort, their Works have nothing that can pleaſe the View or deſerve the Attention of thoſe that are Curious.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are faults which ought to be avoided, as wrong Principles, by the Pupils of Deſigning: Who ought to apply themſelves immediately to the juſt Proportions of the Antients, for therein conſiſt the true Beauties of the Art.</p>
                  <p>They ought to begin with the Studies of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and Perſpective, and with the Poſtures which naturally expreſs the different Actions of the Body, and Paſſions of the Soul. They ought to take care to learn Anatomy, that they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55267:58"/>may know the Motions of the Muſcles, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their juſt Contorſions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the means which ought to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to arrive to the Knowledge of the true Beauty and Excellency of theſe Arts: It has been hereby, that the excellent Modern Painters, and Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Architects have made ſuch advances, to whom we are obliged for the Re-eſtabliſhment of Painting, of Sculpture, and of Architecture: Which ſhall be the Subject of the Third BOOK of this Hiſtory.</p>

                        <hi>The Arts began to flouriſh again in</hi> Toſcany, <hi>in Architecture and Sculpture.</hi>

                  <p>AFTER having ſhewed in the Second Book of this Hiſtory, the cauſes of the declenſion and fall of Painting, and Sculpture, and Architecture, by the ill and rude Methods, and decay from that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence which they had arrived to among the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> we will ſhew in this Third Book how theſe Arts by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle emerged from the rude <hi>Gothick</hi> way, and continued their Re-eſtabliſhment from the year 1013, to the end of 1500; wherein they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to their primitive Perfection, and paſſed from <hi>Italy</hi> into ſeveral other Parts, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into <hi>France,</hi> by the ſingular Favour they found under our Kings, <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55267:59"/>the Fourth, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, who now eſteems it as a part of his Glory to have made the Arts of Deſign to Flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Arts of Deſigning began firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in <hi>Toſcany,</hi> before they were known in other Countries. For as the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> were the firſt among the Ancients who practiſed them, ſo they had the advantage of being the firſt in <hi>Italy</hi> who rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them from the low ſtate to which they were fallen. Thus in the year 1300 there began to appear at <hi>Florence</hi> a better ſort of Architecture than the ancient <hi>Gothick;</hi> for in the Church of St. <hi>Miniate,</hi> Built in that time, Architecture may be obſerved to creep out of its barbarous Methods, and to Imitate in all the parts of that Building, the way of the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>After this happy beginning, the Arts of Deſigning continued on to their Perfection in <hi>Toſcany;</hi> and the <hi>Piſans</hi> in the year 1016 Founded their great Church, called the Dome of <hi>Piſa:</hi> The Commerce they had by Sea, and particularly into <hi>Greece,</hi> was a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means for the Re-eſtabliſhment of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture and Sculpture, for they brought thence ſeveral Columns and Fragments of ancient Architecture of Marble, which they made uſe of in the Fabrick of this Church.</p>
                  <p>They brought together by theſe means ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Engravers in <hi>Italy,</hi> and alſo <hi>Grecian</hi> Painters, who Work'd after their own old Methods; for only uſing in their Painting ſimple Lines, which they Coloured all over equally without any Shadowing, their Works
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55267:59"/>were not very Artificial; notwithſtanding theſe Remainders of Art taught the <hi>Italians</hi> the practice of Painting in Water-Colours, in <hi>Freſco,</hi> and <hi>Moſaick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But among all theſe <hi>Grecian</hi> Artiſts, thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> were the moſt fortunate, in happening on the Architect <hi>Bouchet</hi>

                  <p>PAINTING which was almoſt loſt, began to revive again in the Church of St. <hi>Miniate</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> as is to be ſeen in the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Choir: This was done about the Year 1013, and till the Year 1211 wherein <hi>Cimabüe</hi> was born, we do not ſee that that Art acquired much perfection.</p>

                     <hi>John Cimaboüe</hi> was born at <hi>Florence</hi> with a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Genius and Inclination to Deſigning, which made him neglect other Studies to which he was deſign'd by his Father: For he deceived his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and was continually amuſing himſelf in gratifying the Inclination and Tendency of his Genius. The opportunity which he had of the Society of two <hi>Grecian</hi> Painters, who came to <hi>Florence</hi> to Paint the Chappel of <hi>Gondis,</hi> was very lucky for him to ſatisfy his Inclination that Way: And when his Father ſaw him employ all his time in ſeeing them Work, he began to deſpair of his Sons ſucceeding in Learning, and ſo e'ne let him learn to Paint of theſe two <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Genius and Application which <hi>Cimaboüe</hi> had for Deſign, made him ſoon ſurpaſs his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: Inſomuch that his Works diſtinguiſhing themſelves from the ill and rude Ways, which were then in uſe, ſpread his Reputation through all the Neighbouring Towns, where he made ſeveral Pieces; this began to raiſe Painting again,

                        <p>The Reputation of <hi>Cimaboüe</hi> was ſo Great, that he was choſen Architect with <hi>Arnolphus Lapo,</hi> to order the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Church of St. <hi>Mary Delfiore</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> where he was buried after having lived ſixty Years.

                  <p>But the greateſt Honour which <hi>Cimabos</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was when the King of <hi>Naples, Charles d'Anjou,</hi> went to ſee him Work on the Picture of St. <hi>Mary Novella.</hi> This Honour cauſed a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Joy in the Citizens of that City, inſomuch that they made Feaſts and publick Rejoycings.</p>

                  <p>Thus Deſigning and Painting began to Emerge out of Ignorance, wherein they had lain buried for above nine hundred Years in <hi>Italy;</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then began to favour them, viſibly pouring out its Gifts on the Perſon of <hi>Ghiotto</hi> Pupil of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabos.</hi> For when he was a young Child, and in the Country guarded his Fathers Flocks, he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed Deſigning with a ſharp pointed Stone for a Pencil on the Ground which he had made ſmooth on purpoſe, where he drew the Figures of his Sheep. One day as <hi>Cimabos</hi> walk'd out into the Fields, he found little <hi>Ghiotto</hi> buſied about this Affair, which made him ſtop and admire him.

                  <p>In a ſhort Time <hi>Ghiotto</hi> learnt of his Maſter the Principles of the Art, and far ſurpaſſed him therein, by the ſtudy and imitation of Nature, applying himſelf chiefly to draw Pourtraictures and Hiſtories, which gain'd him ſo much Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, That Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the IX. ſent for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he drew ſeveral Pieces in the Church of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> After this his Succeſſor <hi>Clement</hi> the V. carried him to the City of <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he painted ſeveral Works in <hi>Freſco,</hi> and ſome Pieces for <hi>France.</hi>

                        <p>This <hi>Paulus</hi> was alſo an excellent Worker in Gold; he made alſo the Apoſtles in Silver, which were on an Altar in the Pope's Chappel, and which were pillaged by the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> at the taking <hi>Rome.</hi> One of his Contemporaries in Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was <hi>Mino;</hi> he made the two Figures of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which are placed in the Entrance of that Church, and the Sepulchre of <hi>Paul</hi> the Second in the ſame Church.</p>

<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <p>One of the greateſt Genius's in Painting of the Age, 1400. was <hi>Dominick Ghirlandaio,</hi> of whom we have made mention in the Fourth Chapter, which is evident by the great number of his Excellent Works. Nature gave him a very great Inclination for Painting, which was the reaſon he left off from his Youth following the Trade of a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, wherein his Father had Educated him; he was the firſt who invented that Dreſs which the <hi>Florentine</hi>-Maids wear on their Heads, called <hi>Ghirlande;</hi> whence he was named <hi>Dominick Ghirlandaio.</hi> As he ſucceeded in the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Painting, he imitated in his Colours the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gold, which till that time were done with real Gold. The Reputation of <hi>Dominick</hi> got to <hi>Rome,</hi> where Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth ſent for him to Paint in his Chappel; at his Return to <hi>Florence,</hi> he painted the Chappel of <hi>Ricci,</hi> which was one of the chief Pieces; he was uſed to ſay that Deſigning was true Painting, and that <hi>Moſaick</hi> was the moſt durable; he dy'd at 44 Years of Age, in the Year 1493. His Diſciples were <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Benedict Chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landaio, Sebaſtian Maimardi, Michael-Angelo Buonarotti,</hi> and ſeveral other Ingenious <hi>Florentine</hi>-Maſters.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame time <hi>Benedict da Maiano</hi> diſtinguiſhed himſelf at <hi>Florence</hi> in Sculpture and Architecture, as did alſo <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Peter Pollaivoli, Florentine</hi> Painters and Sculptors; they dy'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth cauſed them to come; they were very Curious, and the firſt, who ſtudied Anatomy, whereby they made their Works the more perfect.</p>
                        <p>There appeared alſo at <hi>Florence</hi> about this time, <hi>Philip Lippia,</hi> Painter, who firſt taught to Paint varieties of Cloathing in his Figures, and therein imitated the Ancients; he had a great Genius in Ornaments and Groteſque, he wrought alſo in Plaiſter; and died at 45 Years of Age. Moreover <hi>Luke Signorelli</hi> of <hi>Cortone,</hi> got Reputation by his Painting in that City, and in <hi>Arezzo;</hi> he had a fertil Invention, and a great deal of Grace in Compoſing his Hiſtories, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned very well <hi>Naked-Figures.</hi>

                  <p>Among the reſt, the Illuſtrious <hi>Leonard da Vinci</hi> became a great Maſter therein; for from his Birth he had all the Advantages of Nature, which procured him an eaſy Entrance into all the Arts that depend on Deſigning, and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Muſick, and Poetry, wherein he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonard</hi> learn'd of <hi>Andrew Verrocchio</hi> Painting and Sculpture, but in a ſhort time ſurpaſſed his Maſter in Painting; he ſtudied Perſpective, and the Arts that depend thereon, and penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt hidden Secrets of Anatomy,
<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Leonard da Vinci, Michael Angelo,</hi> and all the beſt Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſtudied Anatomy. <hi>Da Vinci</hi> carefully recommends that Study in his Treatiſe of Painting, as does alſo <hi>Lomazzo</hi> in his. <hi>Charles Alphonſus</hi> of <hi>Freſnoy,</hi> and <hi>D. P.</hi> his Commentator, have alſo ſhewed the neceſſity of <hi>Myology</hi> to become Excellent in Deſigning. The Author of the <hi>Diſcourſes on the Lives,</hi> and the Works of the moſt Excellent Painters, is alſo of this Sentiment; but in treating of this Science, he explains himſelf in very confuſed terms, for he miſtakes the Tendons for the Nerves; for in writing of the Statue of <hi>Laocoon,</hi> in a Conference, in the Academy, he expreſſes himſelf thus, ſaying, <hi>The Nerves and Muſcles form the chief Appearances of that Statue.</hi> And in his Book of <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> ſpeaking of the Muſcles, he teaches in Page 315. of P. T. <hi>That there muſt be had a ſpecial regard to the Muſcles and Nerves:</hi> And in Page 556. he ſays, <hi>That their Motions depend on the Fabrick of the Bones, and Situation of the Muſcles and Tendons, which ſuſtain them, and cauſe their Action.</hi> In another place he ſays, <hi>As the Muſcles and Nerves are more ſupple and pliant; which cauſes an Alteration in the Nerves,</hi> &amp;c. It will not be amiſs, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this for the ſake of young Beginners. To do this, you are to conſider Three Parts in each Muſcle; the Head, the Belly, and the Tail, which are only their Beginning, Middle, and End; this end of the Muſcle, is that which is called the <hi>Tendon,</hi> reſembling Cords, which the Author of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi> calls <hi>Nerves,</hi> at the Feet of <hi>Laocoon;</hi> where it is evident, that they are the <hi>Tendons</hi> of the long and ſhort <hi>Entenſors</hi> of the Fingers, which end at the Articulations of each of them, being there very viſible, by reaſon of the dolorous Motions, which <hi>Ageſander,</hi> the Sculptor, ſhews this Figure to have made at the biting of ſeveral Serpents. As to what this Author ſays, That <hi>the Tendons ſuſtain the Muſcles, and cauſe them to Act;</hi> this is to ſpeak without any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in <hi>Anatomy</hi> or <hi>Deſign;</hi> he might have ſaid, That the Tendons end the Muſcles, but not that they cauſe their Motion. For the Animal Spirits give Motion to the Muſcles, which are communicated to them by the Nerves, which are their Vehicle; but theſe Nerves are diffuſed, and loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among the Membranes, and Fleſh, by ſmall <hi>Ramuli</hi> or Branches, which end like Hairs; ſo that they cannot be ſeen without the Skin; on the contrary, they are the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons that are there ſeen, which indeed the Ancient Language calls Nerves, when Anatomy was not arrived to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as now-a-days. This appears in an old Tranſlation of the Bible, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.25. where the Angel after having wreſtled all Night with <hi>Jacob,</hi> not being able to overcome him, touched him on the Nerve of the Thigh, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately it dry'd and wither'd, and he became Lame (this Nerve is properly the Tendon of the Muſcle, called the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi> of the Thigh). In Memory of this Action, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not Eat in Animals this part, like the Tendon, which was withered in <hi>Jacob</hi> by the touch of the Angel of the Lord. <hi>Idem, Ver.</hi> 32. which evidentlv proves, that it is not only the Nerve, but the Tendon which makes part of the Muſcle.</note> and the Motion of the Muſcles, by the Studies which he made under <hi>Mark Anthony de la Tour,</hi> Profeſſor in that Science.</p>

                  <p>But as <hi>Leonardo</hi> was always meditating on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Things, for the Glory of the Prince whom he ſerved, he made a Model in Earth of a Figure on Horſeback, of a remarkable heigth, and ſingular Beauty, with a deſign to Caſt it in Braſs; but that was not done, whether for the difficulty of Founding ſo great a Work, or for ſome other Reaſon; and this fine Model was ruined when the <hi>French</hi> conquered the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.</hi>

                  <p>After <hi>Lewis Sforza</hi> was carried into <hi>France, Leonardo</hi> returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he Painted ſeveral Pieces, and deſigned upon large thick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, like Paſtboard, which <hi>Raphael</hi> alſo made uſe of, and thereon brought to Perfection the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>Perrugin,</hi> his Maſter. <hi>Julian de Medicis</hi> did no leſs Honour to <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> than the Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi> For, beſides the other Careſſes he ſhew'd him, he carried him to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Election of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, and he receiv'd of this Pope the like Honour; but the Jealouſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                  <p>IT was <hi>Raphael d'Urbin,</hi> who raiſed Painting in the laſt Age to its higheſt degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: His Works which are at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> at <hi>Bologna</hi>

                        <p>At <hi>Bologna</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> on the Hill are ſome admirable Pieces of <hi>Raphael,</hi> which repreſent St. <hi>Ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> with other Saints. <hi>Raphael,</hi> when he had finiſhed this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, ſent it to <hi>Francis Francia</hi> a Painter of <hi>Bologna,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to take care to ſet it up at the Altar he had diſign'd it for; <hi>Francia</hi> who believ'd himſelf to be a better Painter than in reality he was, and who had a great Deſire to ſee the Works of <hi>Raphael,</hi> whom he only knew by Fame, and by the great Reputation he had gotten, was glad of this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but he had no ſooner taken the Picture out of its Caſe, but he was ſo ſurprized at its Excellence, and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a Melancholy by finding himſelf ſo much Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to <hi>Raphael,</hi> that he fell Sick and in a few days dyed. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari, Vita de Pitt.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Francis Francia</hi> was born in the Year 1450; he was brought up a Goldſmith, wherein he excell'd in working in Enamel, and graving of Coins for Money; his Medals equall'd thoſe of <hi>Caradoſſe,</hi> as is to be ſeen by thoſe of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the IId. of the Seignior <hi>Benti-Voglio,</hi> and by all the Coins of the Money of <hi>Bologna</hi> which he cut as long as he lived. He took up Painting after he was acquainted with <hi>Andrew Mantegna;</hi> he was the firſt Painter of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all the <hi>Bolognians</hi> that went before him; his School was ſo Famous that by relation of <hi>Malvaſia,</hi> he had brought up two hundred Diſciples; one of the beſt who learned of <hi>Francia</hi> was <hi>Laurence Coſta,</hi> whereof we have ſpoken in the VIIth Chap. <hi>Malvaſia Vite de' Pitt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Author denies what <hi>Vaſari</hi> relates of the Death of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> becauſe this Painter had ſeen other Pictures of <hi>Raphael,</hi> before he received that of St. <hi>Cecilia;</hi> and had teſtified to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> in Letters that paſſed between them, the Eſteem he had for him, as the Painter of Painters; which he takes notice of in theſe Words, <hi>che tu ſolo il pittor ſei de' pittori.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Malvaſia</hi> moreover complains of <hi>Vaſari,</hi> That he would not own that there were Painters at <hi>Bologna</hi> at leaſt as ſoon as at <hi>Florence,</hi> for he ſays, that in the Year 1115 to 1140 there appear'd at <hi>Bologna Guido, Ventura</hi> and <hi>Orſon,</hi> who embelliſh'd with Pictures the Churches of <hi>La Madonna de Lambertazzi,</hi> of St. <hi>Eſtienne,</hi> and ſeveral others of that City. Afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Marin</hi> the Goldſmith and Engraver, and <hi>Franco de Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi> Painter, contemporary of <hi>Giotto,</hi> who notwithſtanding follow'd the <hi>Gothick</hi> Way; in the mean time they were very much praiſed by <hi>Dante: Franco</hi> work'd for Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the IXth, in the <hi>Vatican.</hi> It was he who ſet up the firſt School of Painting at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and brought up ſeveral Pupils, and among the reſt <hi>Simon, Jacob de Avanzi,</hi> and <hi>Vitale</hi> who ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. This laſt flouriſhed about the Year 1345, and the others in 1370. At firſt <hi>Simon</hi> only painted Crucifix's, whence he got the Name of <hi>Simon</hi> of the <hi>Crucifix;</hi> and as for <hi>Jacob</hi> he only drew Pictures of the Virgin: Their Works have been praiſed by <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> and the <hi>Characci.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the ſame time appeared <hi>Galeazzo</hi> of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Chriſtoſano da Modena,</hi> theſe Painters wrought in the Church called <hi>La Caſe di Mezzo,</hi> without the Gate <hi>Mammola:</hi> And all their Works appear'd in the Year 1400. <hi>Jacob</hi> moreover work'd with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digieri de Levio</hi> a Famous Painter. <hi>Lippo Dalmaſio</hi> was Diſciple of <hi>Vitale</hi> and taught Painting to <hi>M. Galante</hi> the <hi>Bolognians</hi> This <hi>Lippo</hi> as <hi>Malvaſia</hi> pretends painted in Oyl. From the Year 1400. Painting grew more and more to Perfection at <hi>Bologna</hi> by <hi>Mattheo;</hi> one of his moſt famous Pieces was at St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which he painted in Oyl in 1443 under the little Gate of the Fiſhery. Afterwards <hi>Severus</hi> of <hi>Bologna</hi> wrought in 1460. <hi>James Ripenda</hi> painted ſeveral Pieces at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Deſigned the whole <hi>Trajan</hi> Column; there were at that time ſeveral ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good <hi>Bolognian</hi> Painters, whereof <hi>Marco Zoppo</hi> was One, his Works appear'd about the End of the Age 1400, he was Diſciple of <hi>Squarcione:</hi> But his greateſt Glory was to have brought up <hi>Francis Francia</hi> who revived Painting at <hi>Bologna,</hi> from the low Eſtate whereunto it was fallen, and introduced the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Guſto of Deſigning and Painting as we have ſhewn.</p>
                     </note> and in <hi>France</hi> are illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proofs of it, and give Subject both for our Admiration and Study.</p>

                  <p>This rare Perſon had a very happy Genius, and from his Infancy a great Inclination for Painting: He learn'd the Principles from his Father, in the City of <hi>Urbin,</hi> which was his Native Country: But his Father ſeeing that from his Youth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, put him to <hi>Peter Perugino</hi> one of the moſt renowned Painters of <hi>Florence:</hi> Whom <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> in a ſhort time ſo well imitated, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Work of this Diſciple ſurpaſſed that of his Maſter. After <hi>Raphael</hi> had left <hi>Perugino,</hi> he travelled to <hi>Siena,</hi> where he heard of the great Eſteem that was made at <hi>Florence,</hi> of a Piece whereon was deſigned a Battel which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Leonard da Vinci</hi> made for the Council Hall. He underſtood alſo that there was another Piece of Deſigning very much admired, which <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> had done in the ſame Hall, where <hi>Leonard</hi> and <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> had painted each one half. This obliged <hi>Raphael</hi> to leave his Work to go to <hi>Florence</hi> to ſee theſe two Famous Pieces: Which he had no ſooner ſeen, but he bethought himſelf that he muſt ſtudy hard to acquire thoſe Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Deſigning, wherein he then acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf inferiour to thoſe two Ingenious Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>Thus he ſtudied very hard to acquire the true Idea of thoſe fine Airs of the Head, that round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, force and perfection of the Works of <hi>Leonard:</hi> he alſo obſerved the Beautiful outlines of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Figures, in the Deſigns of <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> and that that Beauty and Correctneſs proceeded from the true Proportion, and natural Situation of the Muſcles, and the juſt obſervation of their Motions; <hi>Raphael</hi> that he might acquire this Knowledge, ſet himſelf diligently to ſtudy Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and his whole Deſign was to quit the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55267:77"/>manner of his Maſter <hi>Peter Perugino,</hi> wherein he happily ſucceeded: For it was generally more petite, a dryer, and a harder manner than that of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> or <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Method of <hi>Perugino</hi> had not that roundneſs nor true Guſto as the Pieces of <hi>Frà Bartholomew</hi>
                     <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> according to the Language of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try called <hi>Baccio,</hi> began to learn Painting under <hi>Benedict de Maiano,</hi> and afterwards under <hi>Coſimo Roſſelli,</hi> and at laſt he ſet himſelf to Study the Works and Method of <hi>Leonard da Vinci<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> He was perſwaded by the Famous <hi>Jerom Savonarola,</hi> a <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> to quit Temporal Affairs, and to burn all his Works and Deſigns, among which were ſeveral naked Figures, and by a Vow became one of that Religious Order, in the Convent of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Florence;</hi> whence he was ſince named <hi>Frà Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew,</hi> of <hi>St. Mark;</hi> he dyed at the Age of 40 Years in 1517; his Diſciples were <hi>Cechino del Frate: Benedictus Ciamfanini, Gabriel Ruſtici</hi> and <hi>Frà Paolo Piſtoleſe.</hi>
                     </note>, of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> one of the Imitators of <hi>Leomard. Bartholomew</hi> by help of his Studies, and the great Eſteem he had for the Works of that Excellent Man, arrived to that degree of Perfection in true Deſigning, that he was one of the moſt Excellent Painters of his Time. Several Pictures which are at <hi>Florence</hi> and at <hi>Lucca,</hi> in the Churches of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and St. <hi>Romanus</hi> are illuſtrious Proofs it: They appear to this Day as freſh as if they were newly painted: For beſides the Beauty of their Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had a very fine Colour, and a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Relief cauſed by a juſt diſtribution of Light and a grand Force of Shadow, with an admirable Union and Perfection.</p>
                  <p>The Beauty of theſe excellent Pieces very much charmed <hi>Raphael</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and obliged him to contract an intimate Friendſhip with <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> from whom he learn'd with a great deal of Care
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55267:78"/>and Advantage the way of Painting and Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Friendſhip of <hi>Raphael</hi> was alſo no ways diſadvantageous to <hi>Frà Bartholomew,</hi> for <hi>Raphael</hi> communicated to him the Rules of Perſpective, which he was not before ſo well acquainted with as he.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Raphael Sanzio,</hi> joining to the Gifts Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had favoured him with, all the care and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Studies that were neceſſary, formed that fine Method of his, which ſhines through all his rich and judicious Compoſitions. His Poſtures are eaſy, natural and lively in each Expreſſion, his Proportions elegant and taken from the fine Figures of the Antients, all the Airs of his Faces ſo noble that they ſeemed to have ſomething of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in them; in ſhort, he finiſh'd all the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Figures with the utmoſt Perfection, and had the truly fine Way of cloathing them; theſe are thoſe excellent Parts of the Art which make his Pictures the moſt perfect among the Moderns, which this great Painter has made appear in the Palace of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> in all the Halls, and all the Lodges which he painted.</p>
                  <p>This is particularly to be ſeen in his Piece of the Transfiguration at St. <hi>Peters,</hi> in <hi>Montorio,</hi> which has always been eſteemed as one of the chief Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Painting, and beſt Pictures in the World. Thoſe alſo which <hi>Francis</hi> the I. cauſed him to make in Oyl, and which are carefully preſerved in the Cabinet of the King, ſufficiently teſtify this Truth.</p>
                  <p>This Piece of the Transfiguration was alſo the chief Ornament of his Funeral Pomp, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled the publick Sorrow, when they ſaw that admirable Picture, near the Body of that rare Perſon, and that Death had ſo ſoon deprived that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55267:78"/>Excellent Painter of Life, who will always live in the memory of the Lovers of this Art.</p>
                  <p>By this it is eaſy to judge that <hi>Raphael,</hi> was the moſt excellent Genius in this ART, of the laſt Age, and that he carried it to its higheſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But we may alſo ſay, that this admirable Man was Happy to flouriſh under the Popedoms of <hi>Julius</hi> the IId. and <hi>Leo</hi> the Xth. Princes very zealous for the revival of the Arts of Deſigning. For this laſt Pope loved <hi>Raphael</hi> with ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that at the time this Excellent Painter dyed, this Generous Pope had propoſed to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with a Cardinals Hat

                        <p>
                           <hi>Parmeggiano</hi> was a very handſom Man, of a very fine Air, and looked more like an Angel than a mortal Creature. <hi>Parmeggiano</hi> after he went from <hi>Rome</hi> gave himſelf to <hi>Alchymy,</hi> and made ſeveral tryals to ſix Mercury, which depriv'd us of the reſt of his Works.</p>
                        <p>Beſides <hi>Parmeggiano,</hi> the City of <hi>Parma</hi> furniſh'd us with ſeveral other Good Painters, as <hi>Michael Angelo Anſelmi,</hi> who made a Piece after a <hi>Carton</hi> of <hi>Julio Romano</hi> in the Church of <hi>Notre-Dame della Stoccha,</hi> and made there ſeveral other Pictures. <hi>Jerom Mazzuolo</hi> Couſin of <hi>Parmeggiano</hi> gained alſo a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>

                           <hi>Polidore</hi> as well as ſeveral other Ingenious Men left <hi>Rome</hi> when the Imperialiſts came to Beſiege it; he went to <hi>Naples</hi> where he painted ſome Fronts of Palaces, and ſome Pictures in Oyl: Afterwards he went to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where he made ſeveral Pieces in Freſco and in Oyl, and as he was about to return to <hi>Rome</hi> again, he was aſſaſſinated in his Bed by his Servant who robbed him in the Year 1543.</p>

                  <p>He had ſo happy a Genius, that at the Age of ſixteen Years he made of his own head ſeveral fine Pictures at <hi>Parma,</hi> and in the State of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> where he work'd till he was nineteen Years of Age, and then he went to <hi>Rome;</hi> the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Works of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and of <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> drew him thither: He carried along with him three little Pictures, and his own Portrait; which were no ſooner ſeen by Cardinal <hi>Datary,</hi> but he was introduced to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth. who was charmed with the Beauty of his Pictures. <hi>Parmeggiano</hi> by this means got into the Service of the Pope, for whom he made ſeveral Pieces, and, during the time he was at <hi>Rome</hi> he ſo much ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Paintings of <hi>Raphael,</hi> that People uſed to ſay of him, that the Spirit of that great Painter was transfuſed into <hi>Parmeggiano.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This young Painter had ſuch a Love, and ſo aſſiduous an Application to his Art, that being at <hi>Rome</hi> when it was Sacked by the Imperialiſts in 1527, and ſome Soldiers entring into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when he was at Work, he was not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and ſo he was taken and ſet to be ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And bought himſelf off by ſome of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, being happily fallen into the Hands of a <hi>German</hi> Captain who was a great lover of Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but he was no ſooner at Liberty, but he was taken again by other Soldiers, who robbed him of all he had.

                  <p>THE School of the <hi>Bellini</hi> having, as we have ſeen, begun to revive the true Guſt of Painting; their famous Diſciples <hi>Georgeone</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> did much exceed them; for they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, as they yet are, by all Painters, for the greateſt Maſters in the Arts of Colouring, and making Landskips, that ever were.</p>

He alſo apply'd himſelf there to Painting, where after having in a ſhort time learnt the Way of the <hi>Bellini,</hi> he ſurpaſſed them, by reaſon of the vivacity of his Genius, and his ſtrong Inclination to Painting, and his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55267:81"/>Studies on the Pieces of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> whom he happily imitated in the force and ſweetneſs of his Manner. It was by theſe means that <hi>Georgeone</hi> attain'd to the true Way of Painting and Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for which he was fam'd at <hi>Venice</hi> and in <hi>Trevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> and for the Pieces in <hi>Freſco</hi> which he there painted, and for the Pieces in Oyl of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures of the greateſt Captains, as that of the Prince <hi>Gaſton de Foix</hi> which is to be ſeen in the Kings Cabinet.</p>
                  <p>He alſo gave proofs of his Wit and Knowledge in a Diſpute he had at <hi>Venice</hi> with ſome Sculptors, concerning the Preeminence they pretended to over the Painters, becauſe Sculpture repreſents all the Parts of the Body, whereas Painting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents only one: But he ſhew'd them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of this in one of his Pictures, wherein he ſhewed four different Sights or Parts of a Figure. To do this he painted a naked Man who ſhewed his Shoulders, and on the Ground he repreſented a Fountain where were to be ſeen by Reflexion the
<note n="(b)" place="bottom">The Reflexions of Objects from poliſh'd and ſhining Bodies, as well as from Diaphanous ones, like the Water, are very agreeable in Pictures, when made by the Rules of Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as is done by the Illuſtrious <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> who in that as well as ſome other Parts of Painting has exceeded all other Painters. The Author of the Diſcourſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this, and blames Painters for neglecting the Study of them. He gives us in that Part of his Book the Reaſon of thoſe Sorts of Reflexions by a Geometrical demonſtration on a Landskip he Engraved; whereon is repreſented a Terras Walk and a Pillar thereon on the Bank of a River, where they are reflected: But for this Landskip he did not chuſe a good Deſigner, for on the Water he ſhews Places beyond the Column over the top of it, where there could only be the Reflexion of the Terras; wherefore this Example ought not to be taken for a Pattern; in the mean while it is eaſy to find the Practice of repreſenting theſe Reflections: It is only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take the Heigth of the Objects on the River's Bank, and lay them down perpendicularly in a right line forwards to the place where the extremity of the Object reflected would come. But to find the Reflexion of thoſe that are diſtant from the Bank of the River, you muſt prolong the Surface to the Plan of the Elevation of the Bodies, and ſo take the Heigth of this Plan found or imagined, and turn it perpendicularly forwards, then its extremity will be the term of the Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Object that appears on the Water. In the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the principal Terms of Painting, we will give a more ample Demonſtration of this in Figures.</note> Fore-parts of the Figure. On one of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55267:82"/>the ſides he made a Suit of poliſh'd Armor whence one of the Sides was reflected, and on the other ſide there was ſeen a Looking-Glaſs which reflected the other: And after this way <hi>Georgeone</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at one View thoſe different Aſpects; and this Picture was eſteemed one of the beſt of his Painting. This excellent Perſon dyed at the Age of thirty four Years of the Plague in 1511, with this further Encomium, that he had taught the true Way of Painting to <hi>Titian</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called <hi>Frate del Piombo.</hi>

                     <hi>Titian Vecellio</hi> of <hi>Cadora</hi> was born in 1477, he came to <hi>Venice</hi> at ten Years of Age, where he gave the firſt hints of his Inclination to Painting; his Friends put him to <hi>John Bellino,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcovered an excellent Genius for learning all the Arts neceſſary and requiſite to Painting. But in the Year 1507, finding that the Method of <hi>Georgeone</hi> ſurpaſſed that of <hi>Bellino,</hi> he imitated <hi>Georgeone</hi> with a great deal of care, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Diſciple, and even exceeded him, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the moſt famous Colourer of his Time: As all Painters have ſince acknowledged.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:55267:82"/>
                  <p>This obliged <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to ſay when he knew <hi>Titian</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> That if at the beginning of his Studies, he had been as happy as the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> to have had as well as they the Antiquities to have learned by, he would been the firſt Painter in the World.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Titian</hi> Deſigned the beſt of any of the <hi>Venetian</hi> School; he particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in Deſign thoſe of the laſt Age, and this appear'd in his Picture of Loves which was at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Ludoviſian</hi> Vineyard: For the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Pouſſin</hi> ſtudied afterwards with the Famous Sculptor <hi>Francis Fiamingo,</hi> who made the Cupids in that Piece, and who by this means learned thereby the true Guſto and way of making In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, whereby he got ſo great an Eſteem for Sculpture.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>BY the Examples of all thoſe great Men we have but now mentioned, it is evident, that this Curioſity had got among the Great Princes of the laſt Age, who gave Proofs even to Emulation of their endeavours to Revive the Arts of Deſigning. Thus Painting and Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture made great Progreſſes by the Protection they found from the Princes, and the Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Excellent Perſons who Cultivated them.</p>
                  <p>At this time theſe Arts continued to flouriſh at <hi>Mantua;</hi> for after Deſigning had begun to be eſtabliſhed there by the Curioſity of thoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs's and Dukes, who employ'd <hi>Leon Baptiſta Alberti Coſta,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Mantegna,</hi> the famous <hi>Julio Romano</hi> made that City very fine.</p>
                  <p>Thus, when this Illuſtrious Deſigner had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Painting <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Hall at <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Raphael,</hi> his Maſter, was to have done; <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> went thither, where he was ſo charm'd with <hi>Julio,</hi> that he oblig'd him to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and come to <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He there immediately ordered him to Build the Palace of <hi>T.</hi> whereof he afterwards painted all the Apartments; and it was in theſe Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Works, that he ſhew'd the Greatneſs and Vivacity of his Genius; there is to be ſeen on the four ſides of the Hall, which is painted in Freſco, the Overthrow of the Giants; and on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55267:84"/>the Cieling, <hi>Jupiter</hi> darting his Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts; as alſo all the reſt of the Gods amazed at their Boldneſs. <hi>Julio,</hi> moreover, painted the <hi>Loggia</hi> or Gallery of this Palace, where are the Hiſtories of <hi>David;</hi> and alſo Embelliſh'd the Great Hall with the Fables of <hi>Pſyche</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> He adorn'd ſeveral other Apartments with Pictures and Stucco-work, which were all very admirable.</p>
                  <p>He painted, moreover, ſeveral Battels out of <hi>Homer's Iliads</hi> in the Palace of St. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and made fine Pieces of Tapiſtry for the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which repreſented the Combats and Triumph of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> whereof the King, the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Modena;</hi> have each a Suit of Hangings, very richly high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd with Gold
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Theſe Tapiſtries were made in <hi>Flanders</hi> by <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſta Roux,</hi> very ingenious Workmen.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But as his Genius was univerſal, and he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all the Parts of Deſigning; Architecture, which is one of them, took up moſt of his time at <hi>Mantua;</hi> for beſides the Palace of <hi>T.</hi> which he Built, he made the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſeveral others of a very regular Architecture. It was he alſo who found the way of preſerving that Noble City from the Inundations of Water of the <hi>Lake,</hi> which runs round it; he Built there ſeveral Magnificent Palaces, and cauſed the great Streets to be enlarged, which are very beautiful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Julio Romano</hi> gained ſo much here by the Eſteem of the Duke, and of the Cardinal his Brother, that he uſed to ſay, this Painter was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55267:84"/>more Maſter of <hi>Mantua</hi> than he himſelf. Thus the Eſteem and Honour he received of theſe two Princes, engaged him to ſtay there, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Rome,</hi> although the Pope deſired it, to make him chief Architect of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church

                           <hi>Julio Romano</hi> died at the Age of 45. in 1546. There was made on him this Epitaph,

                              <l>Abſtulit (haud mirum) quatuor unus erat.</l>
                           </q> This great Painter had ſeveral Diſciples, the beſt were <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariccio,</hi> a <hi>Bolognian, John dal Lione, Raphael dal Colle Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe, Benedict Pagni da Peſcia, Figurino da Faenſa, Rinaldo</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſta Mantuano,</hi> and <hi>Fermo Guiſoni.</hi>

                        <p>At <hi>Cremona,</hi> near <hi>Mantua,</hi> Painting began to flouriſh ever ſince <hi>Pordenone</hi> made there ſome Pieces in Freſco, and in Oyl, which ſhew'd the true Guſto of Painting to <hi>Camillo,</hi> Son of <hi>Boccacino,</hi> to <hi>Bernard da Gatti,</hi> called <hi>Soardo,</hi> who work'd at <hi>Panna,</hi> and to <hi>Galeazzo Campo,</hi> who had three Sons Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Julius, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Vincent.

                        <p>In Sculpture, as well as Painting, there have been Women very famous, particularly <hi>Porperzia de' Roſſi</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi> who was very much admired in that City for her Painting, and by the Works ſhe made in Marble; ſhe died in the time that <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth came to <hi>Bologna</hi> to Crown <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth.

                           <hi>Milan</hi> alſo brought up ſome very good Painters, one of the moſt Ancient of whom, is <hi>Bramantine,</hi> who work'd for Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Vth. in the <hi>Vatican;</hi> but his Painting was taken down, and <hi>Raphael</hi> has ſince painted the ſame place. He was alſo an Architect, and made ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Buildings at <hi>Milan,</hi> which were of uſe to <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi> when he firſt ſtudied Architecture in that City. At the ſame time <hi>Buſto,</hi> Surnamed <hi>Bambaia,</hi> diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the Sculptors of his time, by ſeveral Pieces he made at <hi>Milan,</hi> and particularly by the Sepulchre of the Count of <hi>Foix,</hi> which is in the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which was made with extraordinary Care and Patience. The <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> which are on the Front of the Dome at <hi>Milan,</hi> is of <hi>Chriſtopher Gobbo,</hi> who was Contemporary with <hi>Bambaia;</hi> there were alſo other Sculptors and Architects, who Embelliſh'd that City and Dome with their Works, as did <hi>Angelo, Il Ceciliano, Tofanon Lombardino, Silvio da Fieſole,</hi> and <hi>Francis Brambilati;</hi> but Painting was perfected at <hi>Milan,</hi> after the Works of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> appeared there.

                  <p>This ſhews us, that not only Painting flouriſh'd in ſeveral Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and at <hi>Mantua;</hi> but alſo that Architecture has always been inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Deſigning; and more particularly to ſhew the Progreſs of Architecture after it's arrival.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Architecture arrived to a very great Excellency at</hi> Rome.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE famous <hi>Ser-Bruneleſchi</hi> began to bring Architecture out of the rude <hi>Gothick</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which had been practiſed at <hi>Florence,</hi> and other places, down to 1400. For he eſtabliſhed in that City the uſe of the <hi>Dorick, Ionick,</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Orders, in all their Purity, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe juſt Rules he had ſtudied at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Ancient Buildings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leon Baptiſta Alberti</hi> followed the Footſteps of this Illuſtrious Architect and Sculptor, and in Imitation of him continued at <hi>Florence</hi> the true Guſto of Architecture, by reaſon that he was an excellent Geometrician and good Deſigner. His Treatiſe of the Orders, and his Works of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, are a proof of it.</p>
                  <p>The famous <hi>Bramante,</hi> by his Excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, continued to improve the latter part of this Age, as <hi>Bruneleſchi</hi> and <hi>Leon Baptiſta</hi> had done; and alſo the beginning of the Age, 1500. wherin he lived. <hi>Bramante</hi> learnt Painting from his Youth, and gained his Livelihood thereby for a long time, in the State of <hi>Urbin,</hi> (where he was Born) and in ſeveral Cities of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where he made ſeveral Pictures. But as he had alſo a Genius for very great things, he went to <hi>Milan</hi> to conſider the Building of the great Church there, then under the Conduct and Management of <hi>Caeſarianus,</hi> a very Ingenious Architect; and <hi>Bernardino da Trevio,</hi> a <hi>Milaneſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55267:86"/>alſo a good Painter, and Architect, and Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer, who was very much eſteem'd by <hi>Leonardo Vinci,</hi> though his way of Painting was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dry.</p>
                  <p>The Reflections which <hi>Bramante</hi> made on this famous Church, together with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he gained by thoſe two Architects, who were the Managers and Deſigners of it, made him have a mind to apply himſelf wholly to the Study of Architecture; whereupon he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where having kept together what he had gotten by Painting, he ſurvey'd with a particular Care and Curioſity the magnificent Ancient Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that City, thoſe of <hi>Tivoli</hi> and of <hi>La Villa Adriana;</hi> his Affection to Architecture led him alſo to <hi>Naples,</hi> to obſerve all the fine Remainders of Antiquity which are there and thereabouts. He there met with the Protection of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Archbiſhop, who had ſuch an Eſteem for him, that a little after he Engaged him to make at <hi>Rome</hi> the Cloyſter of the Church of Peace. Afterwards he was employed by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VIth. and he ſhew'd his Skill in the Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Palace of the Chancery, and of the Church of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> in <hi>Damaſo.</hi> He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd, moreover, ſeveral Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> by Frontiſpieces of his own Deſigning; that of St. <hi>James</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of St. <hi>Mary del l'Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and of St. <hi>Mary del Popolo,</hi> are convincing proofs of it; as alſo the little Temple of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, which is conſecrated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Mont-Orio:</hi> Theſe Works and ſeveral others gain'd him ſo much reputation, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowledged the beſt Architect of his time; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that in 1503. <hi>Julius</hi> the Second being Pope took him into his Service, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55267:86"/>to gain Admiration by his Buildings in the Lodgings of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and by thoſe of the Palace of <hi>Belvidere.</hi> But that whereby this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Architect got the greateſt Credit, was his Deſign of the

                        <p>This Architect, beſides the Beauty of the Orders which he brought into uſe again, found out ſeveral fine things in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, as the way of making Vaults in Plaiſter, which was alſo uſed by the Ancients. <hi>Vaſari. Vit. del Bramante.</hi>

                     <hi>Michael San Michel,</hi> ſtudied the Principles of Architecture at <hi>Verona,</hi> under his Father and Uncle, who were very good Architects; but at Sixteen Years of Age he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there meaſured the fine Ancient Buildings round about it, and thereby became skilled in every part of Architecture, inſomuch that Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> VIIth. gave him a Penſion to go with <hi>Sangallo,</hi> and Fortify the Frontiers of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick State, particularly <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia.</hi> Afterwards he returned to <hi>Verona,</hi> whoſe fine Gates he made, and the Republick employ'd him in the Principal Buildings of the State, in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and on the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> among which may be reckoned the Fortreſs of <hi>Lido.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>John Maria Falconetti,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Verona,</hi> was a very famous Architect: He learnt Painting of his Father; but becauſe he did not get much by it, he ſet himſelf to Study the Antiquities of the City; after which he went to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> to Survey the Buildings of the Ancients, where he employ'd himſelf for the ſpace of twelve Years, and omitted nothing in his Deſigns, neither there, nor in the Parts round about. But as he had not ſufficient Means to continue his Studies long, he employ'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55267:89"/>himſelf ſome Days in the Week in Painting, thereby to ſupply his Neceſſities.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards returning to <hi>Verona,</hi> and finding there no opportunity of employing himſelf in Architecture, he found himſelf obliged to take up Painting again; but through good luck he found in that City <hi>Signior Cornaro,</hi> who was a great lover of Architecture, who cauſed him to come to his Houſe, where he dwelt twenty one Years; he employ'd himſelf all this while in Working, and exerciſing that Art, which <hi>Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netti</hi> had ſo much ſtudied. Thus theſe three Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Architects of <hi>Verona</hi> introduced the true Guſto and Way of Building into the <hi>Venetian</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>This true and regular Way of Building was continued there, and even augmented by <hi>James Sanſovino,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who embelliſh'd <hi>Venice</hi> with the greateſt and moſt regular Buildings that are there to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>The famous <hi>Sanſovino</hi> began from his Youth to ſtudy Deſigning and Sculpture at <hi>Florence,</hi> which he very ſucceſsfully practiſed; he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a great Reſpect for <hi>Andrew del Sarto,</hi> an Excellent Painter. After this he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he got acquainted with <hi>Raphael</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi> who did him Juſtice in their Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of his Skill to <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> had at that time great Inclinations to build themſelves National Churches at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> alſo obtain'd the ſame favour from the Pope.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Florentines</hi> cauſed ſeveral Models to be made by <hi>Raphael, Baldaſſare, Anthony Sangallo,</hi> and <hi>Sanſovino.</hi> It was the Deſign of this laſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55267:89"/>that they choſe: And <hi>Sanſovino</hi> began to build the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> for the <hi>Florentines</hi> according to the Model he had made of it. But this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was diſcontiuned during the Popedom of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> the VIth, a Fleming by his Countrey, who had no affection nor guſt for the Arts of Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Inſomuch, that if he had reigned long theſe Arts would have infallibly ſunk into their old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, at leaſt at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth ſucceeded him, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this misfortune; for he ſet to Work all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious in theſe Arts: And <hi>James Sanſovino</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by theſe means the Fabrick of the Church of the <hi>Florentines</hi> till the Year 1527, wherein the Army of <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth beſieged <hi>Rome,</hi> which chaſed away from that City a great Number of excellent Men. <hi>Sanſovino</hi>

                        <hi>James Sanſovino</hi> died at <hi>Venice</hi> at the Age of 78 Years; he brought up ſeveral Diſciples at <hi>Florence</hi> and at <hi>Venice,</hi> who were <hi>Nicholas,</hi> called <hi>il Tribolo,</hi> who wrought in the Abby of Mount <hi>Caſſin, Jerom de Ferrara,</hi> who wrought much at <hi>Loretta</hi> and <hi>Venice.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE great <hi>Michael Angelo Buonaruoti,</hi> had the ſame Honour at <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovino</hi> at <hi>Venice:</hi> For he ſhewed his Capacity in Architecture in thoſe two Cities, and in the laſt Age advanced that Art to its higheſt Perfection. The reaſon of this is very evident and no ways ſurprizing, for being the greateſt Deſigner of his Time he became alſo the greateſt Architect, when he apply'd his Time wholly to it as he did during his laſt Years.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55267:90"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> was born at <hi>Florence</hi> in 1474, with a natural Inclination for Deſigning; for although in his Youth he was brought up to Learning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he buſied himſelf always in private about Deſigning: And as his Father ſaw that he had a very great Inclination for Painting, he put him to <hi>Dominick Ghirlandaio,</hi> for him to inſtruct him therein; and in a little time <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> diſtinguiſh'd himſelf from other Diſciples, by the ſurprizing Facility wherewith he deſigned: This great Genius was very fortunately favoured by Prince <hi>Laurence de Medicis,</hi> by reaſon of the great Paſſion this Prince had to aſſiſt the Revival of the Arts, by aſſiſting Men skilled and learned therein. This generous Temper made him eſtabliſh in the Gallery of his Gardens an Academy which he fill'd with fine Pictures and Pieces of Sculpture both Ancient and Modern. Afterwards he cauſed to be ſought out at <hi>Florence</hi> thoſe Young Deſigners who promiſed moſt, to whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd Penſions to promote the conveniency of their Studies. Thoſe of the School of <hi>Ghirlandaio</hi> were choſen the firſt, and particularly <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> who had ſo lively a Genius for all the Parts of Deſigning, that one day having taken up a piece of Marble, he ſet about making a Head, tho' as yet he had never handled a Chiſel; which ſo much ſurprized Prince <hi>Laurence,</hi> that he conceived ſo great an Affection for <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi> that beſides the Penſion he allow'd him, he did him the Honour to admit him to his own Table, and gave him a Lodging in his Palace. After the Death of this Prince, his Succeſſor <hi>Peter de Medicis,</hi> continued to <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> the ſame Affection he had been favoured with by the Great Duke his Father.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:55267:91"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Signor Soderini Gonfaloniere</hi> of the ſame Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, had no leſs eſteem for this ingenious Man than theſe two Princes; and about the ſame time <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> made a <hi>Cupid</hi> of Marble which was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and hidden under Ground, to pretend that it was an Ancient one: It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dug up and ſold for ſuch to Cardinal St. <hi>George,</hi> and this <hi>Cupid</hi> paſſed for one of the moſt rare and fine Pieces of Antiquity. Hereby this famous Sculptor acquired a great Reputation at <hi>Rome;</hi> whither he went for the firſt time: He continued Sculpture there with a great Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made a <hi>Bacchus</hi> of Marble with ſeveral other admirable Statues. At his return to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> he apply'd himſelf with the ſame diligence to that fine Art, and made a Marble <hi>David,</hi> which was ſet up before the Palace. <hi>Peter Soderini,</hi> and all the Citizens were ſo charmed with this Piece, that they obliged this famous Deſigner to make ſome more of them, ſome in Braſs and others in Painting. Then <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> ordered him to Paint one half of the Council Hall, and <hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> the other.</p>
                  <p>It was here that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> made a Piece to Parallel that of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> which was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in this Work gave proofs of the Excellence of his Deſigning, both in reſpect of the compoſition of the Subject, which was the War of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and in his correctneſs in naked Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: And to have an opportunity of ſhewing it the better, he choſe the time when ſeveral of the Soldiers uſed to bath themſelves in the River <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> to introduce into his Deſigning naked Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, in which he was Excellent; it was this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Piece that gave <hi>Raphael</hi> and ſeveral others an inſight to the Perfection of Deſigning.</p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:55267:91"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Julius</hi> the IId being raiſed to the Papal Chair ſent for <hi>Michal Angelo</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> reſolving to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to make him a <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>ad vincula.</hi> Here is to be ſeen that fine Figure of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and ſeveral others, and the excellent Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which joined together make this fine Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher. This great Deſign was not executed according to the largeneſs of its firſt Model, but was reduced to what it is, whence <hi>France</hi> has the Honour of two Statues of Marble which were to be placed on each ſide of the Sepulcher, and which are at preſent in the Caſtle of <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The working of this <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> was for a long time interrupted, becauſe the Pope ſet <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to Paint in Freſco the arched Ceiling of the Chappel of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the IVth, which ſo much raiſed his Reputation, that beſides the general Applauſe he received at <hi>Rome,</hi> he received conſiderable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from Pope <hi>Julius:</hi> He deſerved both the one and the other; for he alone painted that Vault af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo admirable a way, that the famous <hi>Caraches,</hi> who came after him, took thence their magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ideas in the Painting of the Palace of <hi>Farneſe</hi> at <hi>Rome. Julius</hi> the IId being dead, <hi>Leo</hi> the Xth his Succeſſor honoured <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> no leſs than he had done, for he employ'd him in the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of the Front of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and his Model gained more Eſteem than any other.</p>
                  <p>After this in the Popedom of <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth, he made in the Veſtry of the ſame Church, the Sepulcher of the Houſe of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher even till this time has paſſed for a wonder both of Architecture and Sculpture.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:55267:92"/>
                  <p>This excellent Perſon moreover ſhewed that he was Ignorant in nothing in all the Arts of Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for he alſo fortified the Mount St. <hi>Miniate</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and thereby hindered their Enemies from becoming Maſters of it.</p>
                  <p>But when the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> in 1525 obliged ſeveral ingenious Artiſts to leave <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Florence, Michael Angelo</hi> was one of that Number, and went to <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Doge <hi>Gritti,</hi> to whom he had the honour to be known, cauſed him to make the Deſign of the Bridge of <hi>Realto,</hi> which is one of the Maſterpieces of Architecture. He painted in that City ſome Pictures, and among others that of <hi>Leda,</hi> which he gave to the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> who ſent it to <hi>Francis</hi> the Iſt.</p>
                  <p>The Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> being ended, <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there finiſhed the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of <hi>Julius</hi> the IId, after which he painted by order of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the IIId the great Front of the Altar, whereon he repreſented the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it was this only which was not finiſhed of all the Paintings of this Chappel. The Fame of this great Work in Freſco, which is all over the World, ſufficiently denotes its Excellence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in his old Age apply'd himſelf more to Architecture than Painting and Sculpture, becauſe after the death of <hi>Antony Sangallo</hi> Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, the Pope preferr'd <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to any other, and made him chief Architect of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the Apoſtolick Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although he would have excuſed himſelf from it.</p>
                  <p>Having accepted this Charge he went to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, to ſee the Model of <hi>Sangallo,</hi> to finiſh what remain'd to be built of that great Church, and after having examined it, he publickly declared
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55267:92"/>that that Architect had made the Model of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Art, becauſe without ſide he had made too many Pillars, one upon another, and unnceſſary Spires, and too many ſmall Branchings and little Members, which are quite contrary to good Architecture; <hi>laſtly,</hi> that this Model was of a Guſto rather Barbarous than Ancient: Beſides this he ſhew'd that the execution or performance of it would coſt a Million more than one that he would make.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> cauſed another Model to be made in fifteen days time which coſt only five hundred Crowns, whereas that of <hi>Sangallo</hi> coſt four thouſand, and ſeveral Years work; ſo that at laſt this great Church was finiſhed according to the Deſign of <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in the beauty we ſee it now, excepting the Front, which is not his, nor ſo well done as the Architecture of the outermoſt Tower and the back Part of that Church. While <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> carried on this Building, he alſo made ſeveral others which make part of the beauty of <hi>Rome:</hi> Such as the Palace of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> and the Capitol, which excite the Admiration both of Architects and other Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men.</p>

                           <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> died at <hi>Rome</hi> the 17th <hi>February</hi> 1564: He was almoſt ninety Years of Age. This great Man, beſides the Affection of ſeven Popes whom he ſerved, gained a very great Reputation with <hi>Solyman,</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> with <hi>Francis</hi> the 1ſt, <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth, the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> particularly with the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who reigned at the ſame time this illuſtrious Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er died: For when his Body was in the Church of <hi>Sancto Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolo,</hi> and the Pope was about to ſet up a fine Sepulcher for him: This great Duke cauſed his Body to be privately fetch'd away to bury it in his Capital City; and ſince he was not ſo happy as to have him alive, he was reſolved to have him dead; And performed his Funeral obſequies with all imaginable Pomp and Splendor. This Pomp was celebrated in the Church of St. <hi>Croſs</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> attended by all the Gentlemen of the Academy of Deſign; who, on that occaſion gave ſufficient Teſtimony of the Eſteem they had for this their Maſter, by the magnificent Repreſentation, which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Catafalco,</hi> and adorning the whole Church with Painting and Sculpture and Lights.

There was alſo <hi>John de Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> who ought to be eſteemed for his Manner of Painting and Deſigning: He learnt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Titian,</hi> and deſigned ſome excellent Stamps and Plates of Anatomy, which made the Book of <hi>Andrew Veſalius</hi> ſo Famous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heemskirk, Martin de Vos,</hi> and <hi>John Strada</hi> ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Italy</hi> the true Manner of Deſigning and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Strada</hi> made ſeveral Pieces at <hi>Florence</hi> for the Great Duke, particularly ſeveral Patterns for Tapiſtry, whereby he ſhewed that he had an univerſal Genius in all the different Parts of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; his great Capacity procur'd him admittance into the Academy of Deſigning.</p>
                  <p>The low Countries produced ſeveral other Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; <hi>Divic,</hi> and <hi>Quintin</hi> of
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vaſari</hi> ſays, that <hi>Quintin</hi> was of <hi>Louvain:</hi> But <hi>A. F.</hi> thinks he was of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who, from a good Blackſmith and Farrier, became a good Painter, through the natural Inclination he had from his Youth for Deſigning, and the great Paſſion he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd for a Young Woman, who promiſed him Marriage on Condition he became a good Painter: This encouraged him to learn Painting, which he very ſucceſsfully accompliſh'd.</note> 
                     <hi>Louvain</hi> were very much eſteemed for their true Imitation of Nature. <hi>John deCleves</hi> was excellent in Colouring and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Portraits: Inſomuch that <hi>Francis</hi> the Iſt took him into his Service, during which time he drew a great many of the Lords and Ladies of the Court.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Provinces were <hi>John d' Hemeiſſein,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55267:107"/>Martin Cook, John Cornelis,</hi> and <hi>Lambert Scoorel,</hi> who was a Canon at <hi>Utrecht: John belle Jambe, Divick d' Harlem</hi> and <hi>Francis Monſtaret,</hi> were Excellent in Landskips, and odd Fantaſtick Figures. This laſt was imitated by <hi>Jerome Hertoghen Bos, Peter Brueghel</hi> and <hi>Lancelot,</hi> who was very Excellent at painting Fires.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Countries was alſo <hi>Peter Cocuek,</hi> who had a great facility and readineſs of Invention, for he made ſeveral very fine Hiſtorical Deſigns for Tapiſtry; he had a very good Way, and a great deal of practice in Architecture, which made him tranſlate the Books of <hi>Serlio</hi> into <hi>Dutch.</hi> But he who of all the Painters of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ought to be the moſt eſteemed was <hi>Anthony More</hi> Painter to <hi>Philip</hi> the IId King of <hi>Spain:</hi> The Pictures and Portraits which are to be ſeen of this famous Painters Hand will always make him paſs for an excellent Perſon; he learnt Painting of <hi>Lambert Scoorel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several ſpeak alſo with a great deal of Praiſe of <hi>Peter Le Long,</hi> who made at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where he was born, a Picture of the Virgin with other Saints for which he had two thouſand Crowns. <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Paul Bril</hi> were at that time very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for making Landskips; they wrought a long time at <hi>Rome;</hi> and in <hi>Flanders</hi> there appear'd with a very great Reputation <hi>Octavius Vanveen,</hi> who is alſo called <hi>Otto-Venius.</hi> He was Painter to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was Governour of the Low Countries, and afterwards to the Arch Duke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi> It was he who was Maſter of the Famous <hi>Paul Rubens.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter Porbus</hi> of <hi>Bruges</hi> was alſo a Painter; he taught <hi>Francis</hi> his Son to Paint, who continued to learn under <hi>Francis Florus;</hi> this laſt had a Son called <hi>Francis,</hi> who wrought at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Church
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55267:107"/>of St. <hi>Leu</hi> of the reformed <hi>Jacobins,</hi> and in the <hi>Stadt-Houſe,</hi> where he ſhewed his great Capacity.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time Sculpture flouriſh'd in the Low Countries as well as Painting, for thoſe two Noble Exerciſes are Originated from the ſame Principle, which is Deſigning: For this reaſon there were bred in that Country excellent Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Antwerp, John de Dales, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cucur</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>James Bruſca,</hi> all Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Architects. <hi>Bruſca</hi> made ſeveral Pieces for the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and he brought up <hi>John Bologna</hi> of <hi>Douay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was this Famous <hi>John Bologna,</hi> who gain'd the moſt Honour of any to his Nation for Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the Beauty which appear'd in all his Works, which have all of them the true Way and Guſt of the Ancients, wherein he perfected himſelf in <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Florence,</hi> where he reſided, and held the firſt Place in that Art. He was there employ'd by the Princes <hi>de Medicis</hi> to make ſeveral Pieces of Sculpture: The fine Marble Statues, and the great Groupes of Figures in Braſs which adorn the Squares of <hi>Florence,</hi> of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and of <hi>Bologna</hi> are very charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo many proofs of his Excellence, and Monuments of his Glory.</p>
                  <p>There are yet at <hi>Paris</hi> ſome Marks remaining of the Excellence of his Workmanſhip, as the Brazen Horſe whereon is the Figure of <hi>Henry</hi> the IVth in the Square of <hi>Pont-neuf:</hi> Thus we may ſee that both in the Low Countries, and in <hi>France</hi> as well as <hi>Italy,</hi> the Arts of Deſigning had their Revival by the Means and Ways we have ſhewn. That which farther contributed towards it, was the Genius and Application of ſeveral Ingenious Painters, Sculptors and Architects who flouriſh'd in the Centuries 1400 and 1500.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>How Graving contributed towards the Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Arts of Deſigning.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TO finiſh this laſt Book, it remains that we ſhew the Advantage which the Arts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning received by the Invention of Graving, which was found out at <hi>Florence</hi> in 1460; for this Invention was, and is very ſerviceable to bring thoſe Arts to Perfection.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that the Way of Deſigning on Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with the Tools called the <hi>Burin</hi> and <hi>Point,</hi> was one of the happy Means for the Revival of the Arts: For Graving multiplies and imparts Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Deſigns, and fine Ideas of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Painters, Sculptors and Architects; inſomuch that the Prints which are taken off from theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Plates; were of excellent Uſe in the Revival of Deſigning, in ſeveral Countries, which have not had the Advantage, like <hi>Italy,</hi> of fine Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Ancient Architecture and Sculpture, and the Works of the moſt excellent Modern Painters and Sculptors, which are happily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Help of Copper-Plates.</p>
                  <p>This has been, and is ſtill ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> and other Places, that the fine Books of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture have made a great many Good Architects; who without going to <hi>Italy,</hi> where are the fine Relicks of Antiquity, have formed a true and good Manner, and perfected their Studies in this Art by the Help of Graving, which faithfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Plans, Profils, the Elevations and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fineſt Buildings.</p>
                  <p>Painting has alſo the ſame Advantage by Prints as Architecture, and has given that way ſolid Inſtructions to ſeveral Painters. This may
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55267:108"/>be remarked by the Prints of <hi>Mark Antonio</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the Deſigns of <hi>Raphael,</hi> which have taught the true manner of Deſigning to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral very conſiderable Painters.</p>
                  <p>The Illuſtrious <hi>Pouſſin</hi> is an Example of this, in the great Application he made in his Youth to Deſign by thoſe Prints when he was at <hi>Paris.</hi> It was here this Great Painter ſo happily imitated the manner of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and the Ancients, in his admirable Works.</p>
                  <p>The Sculptors moreover received the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from Graving as the Painters, for that made the Deſigns of the fine Figures of the Ancients familiar to them, and all the fine <hi>Baſs Reliefs</hi> of the Famous Columns and Triumphal Arches, which are to be ſeen in the Palaces and Houſes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Graving was found out at <hi>Florence</hi> by <hi>Maſo Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerra</hi> a Goldſmith, who printed all that he grav'd on Silver: Afterwards <hi>Baccio Bandinelli,</hi> who was a <hi>Florentine</hi> Goldſmith, continued that Art, but as he was no good Deſigner, he copied the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>Sandro Boticelli</hi> of that City. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Graving, being then come to the knowledge of <hi>Andrew Mantegna,</hi> an Excellent Painter, who was about that time at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was ſo much enamour'd with it, that he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to learn it, and he graved <hi>Bacchanalians</hi> with the Burin, and a great Triumph he cut in Wood, which was very Admirable. This Art went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from <hi>Italy</hi> into the Low Countries: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> of <hi>Antwerp</hi> who was a Painter, practiſed it, and ſent a great many of his Plates into <hi>Italy,</hi> and continued to make them better and better.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Antwerp, Albert Durer,</hi> in the ſame City began to Grave after a better Manner, Deſign and Compoſition; for he endeavour'd more
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55267:109"/>nearly to follow Nature, and approach the <hi>Italian</hi> way, which he always eſteemed the beſt: About the Year 1503, he made a ſmall Statue of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which ſurpaſſed the Works of <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> and he continued to make ſeveral Plates of Horſes, deſign'd according to Nature, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there of the Prodigal Son.</p>
                  <p>But when he had graved ſeveral of theſe Plates with the Burin, and ſaw, that they took up a great deal of Time, he ſet himſelf to Grave on Wood, that he might publiſh a greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Works, and in the Year 1510 he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of that Sort of Graving the beheading of St. <hi>John,</hi> the Paſſion of our Lord, and ſeveral other Pieces which went quickly off. <hi>Albert,</hi> by the eſteem People ſet on his Works, became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rich; and this engaged him to Grave again with the Burin, and he made a Piece repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Melancholy, three Notre Dames, with the Paſſion of our Lord in thirty ſix Pieces.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Francis Francia</hi> was eſteemed at <hi>Bologna</hi> of the firſt rank of Painters; he had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſciples, whereof <hi>Mark-Antonio Raimondi</hi> was the beſt, by reaſon of his Capacity in Deſigning, which gave him a great Facility in handling the Burin in Goldſmiths Works, in which he was Excellent. But according to a Reſolution he took to Travel, he went to <hi>Venice.</hi> There he ſaw Stamps which <hi>Albert</hi> had made with the Burin, and in Wood. They ſo pleaſed him that he bought of them as far as his Money would reach; among the reſt he had the Paſſion cut in Wood: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reflecting what Honour and Profit he ſhould have gotten, if he had employ'd himſelf to Grave after that way, he at length determined to ſet himſelf wholly thereunto, and he ſo well copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Paſſion of <hi>Albert</hi>'s on Copper, that it was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55267:109"/>taken to have been done on Wood; he alſo put the Mark of <hi>Albert A. D.</hi> thereon, and ſo well imitated that Work, that no body took it for <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi>'s but for <hi>Albert</hi>'s, and it was bought and ſold for ſuch at <hi>Venice;</hi> inſomuch that ſome Copies were ſent to <hi>Albert</hi> of the Paſſion that <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> had done, which made <hi>Albert</hi> ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry, that he went from <hi>Antwerp</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> to complain to the Republick of the Wrongs <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> had done him: But he could obtain nothing thereby, but only that his Mark ſhould be no more put to <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi>'s Pieces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Albert</hi> at his Return to <hi>Antwerp</hi> found a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, <hi>Lucas van Leyden,</hi> who
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Lucas van Leyden</hi> had an extraordinary Inclination for Deſigning even in his Childhood; he made Pictures at the Age of twelve Years; he apply'd himſelf alſo to Graving; at fifteen Years of Age he had grav'd ſeveral Copper Plates; he died at thirty nine. Years of Age in 1533. In the time of <hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Albert,</hi> there appeared with a great deal of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Han Holbein</hi> of <hi>Baſil.</hi> He practiſed alſo Graving; there are of his Hand Wooden Cuts of the Bible, and a Dance of the Dead, which he painted in that City. But his chief Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Painting, which he practiſed a long time in <hi>England,</hi> where he was eſteemed the moſt Ingenious of his Time; he died at fifty ſix Years of Age in 1554.</note> though he was not ſo good a Deſigner as himſelf, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding equall'd him in the Beauty of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Burin, as he made it appear in 1509, by two round Prints; the one was Chriſt carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Croſs, the other his Crucifixion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucas</hi> continued to ſhew his Ingenuity, by a <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which he grav'd in ſixteen Pieces, and by his other Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Albert,</hi> at this, grew jealous of <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and becauſe he would not be excell'd, he redoubled his Application and Induſtry in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. He made ſeveral fine Prints, as St. <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:55267:110"/>St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and ſeveral others, which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his Reputation: For he was not only a good Graver, but alſo a good Painter, Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian and Architect.</p>
                  <p>This may be ſeen by his Treatiſe of the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an human Figure, of Perſpective and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture: His Works have made his Name

                        <p>Albert Durer died at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> his own Country, in 1528, at fifty eight Years of Age. This Epitaph is to be read on his Tomb.</p>

                     </note> Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, for they contributed to the Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Arts in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Italy;</hi> for they were the Prints of <hi>Albert</hi> which engaged <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> to follow Graving, and made him Grave ſo happily the Works of <hi>Raphael,</hi> that are ſo neceſſary to all Deſigners.</p>
                  <p>Thus by the Opportunity <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> had of Copying at <hi>Venice</hi> the Prints of <hi>Albert,</hi> he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a facility and readineſs in Graving, and went afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the firſt Thing he grav'd was a <hi>Lucretia,</hi> after <hi>Raphael:</hi> This was ſhewn to this great Painter, who at the ſame time contracted a Friendſhip with <hi>Mark-Anthonio,</hi> and ſet him to Grave a Plate of the Judgment of <hi>Paris,</hi> another of the Death of the Innocents, and ſeveral others.</p>
                  <p>This was very Advantageous to <hi>Raphael,</hi> and gained him, as well as <hi>Mark-Antonio,</hi> a great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> and created an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation among ſeveral Deſigners, who apply'd themſelves to Graving, and became Diſciples of <hi>Mark-Antonio.</hi>

                  <p>But about this time happened the ſacking and taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> which reduced <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to Beggary. For to redeem himſelf out of the Hands of the Imperialiſts who had made him Priſoner, he was oblig'd to give them all the Money he had, and ſo went from <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he returned no more.</p>
                  <p>About this time was found out the way of Graving in Wood with Chiaro-ſcuro, which make the Prints appear as if they were height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with White by the Pencil; and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who found out this Invention was <hi>Hugo de Carpi,</hi> an indifferently good Painter, but who had a Genius for ſeveral Things.

                  <p>The way of Etching with Aqua-fortis began alſo to be practiſed about this Time, by <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giano</hi> and <hi>Beccafumi,</hi> who etch'd ſeveral Plates.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55267:111"/>(by which he got a great deal of Praiſe, and a large Reward,) is one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable of his Works.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Rome Nicholas Beatrix Lorain</hi> continued this Art; he work'd after <hi>Mutian,</hi> after <hi>Michael Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and after <hi>Ghiotto</hi> the Boat of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Prints, very much eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>There were other <hi>Italian</hi> Gravers who diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd themſelves by their Prints at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin Albert,</hi> who grav'd the fine Frizes after <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore:</hi> And alſo <hi>Vilamen d'Aſſiſe</hi> for the correctneſs of his Deſigning and the liberty of his Burin. The ſame Eſteem is due to <hi>Antony l'Abacco,</hi> who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and graved a Book of the ancient Buildings, which is one of the moſt regular Pieces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture that has been publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>There were ſeveral other ingenious Engravers in the Low Countries; <hi>Hubert Goltius</hi> of <hi>Venlo</hi> was there Famous. He learnt Painting of <hi>Lambert Lombard,</hi> afterwards he graved ſeveral Books of Medals of the Emperors, entituled <hi>Faſti,</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and <hi>Magna Grecia,</hi> and others, of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he compoſed a Diſcourſe in <hi>Latin,</hi> and becauſe he was very well verſed in Hiſtory, he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Quality of Hiſtorian and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Philip</hi> the IId. He died at <hi>Bruges</hi> in 1583. Of the ſame Family of <hi>Goltius</hi> was alſo <hi>Henry,</hi> who employ'd himſelf much in Graving and Painting, having made two Voyages into <hi>Italy,</hi> to perfect himſelf; beſides his Ingenuity in Painting and Graving, he Deſigned incomparably well with his Pen. He was born at <hi>Venlo</hi> in 1558. <hi>Saen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redam, Matam</hi> and <hi>Peter Jode,</hi> were his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelius Cort,</hi> and <hi>Martin Rota,</hi> ſhewed their Capacity by ſome Pieces they grav'd after <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Angelo, Mutian</hi> and others, as alſo <hi>John, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> and <hi>Giles Sadeler,</hi> who were of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55267:112"/>very much the Art of Graving, by the Beauty of their Prints. <hi>Collaert, Philip</hi> and <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Gall</hi> of the ſame Country grav'd there, and afterwards in <hi>Italy,</hi> with a great deal of Reputaion.</p>
                  <p>This Art appear'd alſo in great Splendour in <hi>France</hi> in the time of <hi>Roſſo,</hi> and of the Abbot St. <hi>Martin;</hi> for <hi>Renè,</hi> engraved the moſt Part of their Works, which are at <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inſomuch that in all the Countries where the Arts of Deſigning flouriſhed, Graving flouriſh'd alſo, and was eſteemed as a conſiderable Part of thoſe Arts.</p>
                  <p>But the Perſon who moſt advanced Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about the End of the laſt Age, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it beyond what had been till then done, was the Famous <hi>Auguſtin Carrache:</hi> For, not to mention the Correctneſs and excellent manner of Deſigning he was Maſter of, to a very high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he made the Strokes cut with his Burin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme even, and extraordinarily well managed according to the chief Turns and Forms of his Object, even to Landskips, which he touch'd incomparably well.</p>
                  <p>From his Youth he learnt Painting at <hi>Bologna</hi> of <hi>Proſper Fontana,</hi> afterwards he ſtudied Graving and Architecture under <hi>Dominick Tibaldi.</hi> In a ſhort time he exceeded his Maſter, who got con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably by the Ingenuity of his Diſciple. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> had alſo a great Love for Sculpture, which made him work in <hi>Relievo</hi> under <hi>Alexander Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganti</hi> a <hi>Bolonian.</hi> Notwithſtanding which he did not leave off Graving, for he had a general Genius, which led him to Learning, to Geometry, and all its dependencies.</p>
                  <p>He went afterwards with his Brother, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Hannibal Carrache</hi> to ſtudy Painting in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> and to learn the charming fine Manner of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55267:112"/>Painting of <hi>Correggio:</hi> But he left his Brother at <hi>Parma,</hi> and went himſelf to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd himſelf in graving the Pictures of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toret</hi> and <hi>Paul Veroneſe,</hi> and thereby render'd their Works more Famous, by the Beauty of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, which made his Prints more perfect than thoſe of other Gravers. He moreover grav'd ſeveral Pieces after <hi>Correggio,</hi> after <hi>Baroche,</hi> and made alſo ſeveral Plates after the Life, of his own Invention, which are all very admirable.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo True that toward the End of the laſt Age, <hi>Auguſtin Carrache</hi> advanced Graving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe who had preceeded him; and that which farther diſtinguiſh'd him from other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, was the excellence and correctneſs of his Deſign. For he had ſo paſſionate a Deſire to make thoſe Arts Flouriſh, that he with his Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Brother <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and their Couſin <hi>Lewis Carrache</hi> eſtabliſh'd an Academy at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was this Famous School which brought up the moſt Ingenious Deſigners and Famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Bologna,</hi> who maintained the excellence of Deſigning and Painting, in the higheſt Pitch thoſe Noble Arts have arrived to ſince their revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. It is to theſe <hi>Carraches</hi> we are obliged, for having hindred Painting, at the beginning of our Age, from a total Declenſion at <hi>Rome,</hi> which then threatned it, by reaſon that the Manneriſts of the School of <hi>Joſeph Arpino,</hi> and thoſe of the School of <hi>Caravage,</hi> who were their Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts, got the better of thoſe who followed the Guſto of the Ancients, and the noble Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Raphael.</hi> But at laſt the Ingenious Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Academy of the <hi>Carraches,</hi> got the day both from the one and the other, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed the true way of Deſigning and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55267:113"/>which has ever ſince happily continued down to us: And throughout all this Age of 1600 theſe Arts have appear'd and continued in Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which ſhall be the Subject of the <hi>Second</hi> Part of the Hiſtory of theſe Arts.</p>
                  <p>By the Ingenious Gravers we have mentioned in this laſt Chapter, it may be noted that we reckon Graving among the Arts that depend on Deſigning and Painting, as Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to them, for the Painters firſt began the right Practice of it, and to advance it to that high Degree wherein now we ſee it.</p>
                  <p>We may moreover ſee that the Way of making the Punchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Dies for ſtriking of Medals, is one Sort of Graving, which depends on Sculpture: And that the moſt Excellent Gravers have been all well verſed both in Sculpture and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; for they never Grave their Coins, till they have firſt modell'd their Works: Thus Sculpture preceeds Graving. The ingenious Medalliſts in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the IId and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the IVth, were Sculptors; and we commonly hold, that <hi>John Goujon</hi> made the fineſt Medals of this firſt King, and of <hi>Catharine de Medicis</hi> which are to be ſeen. <hi>John Rondelle</hi> and <hi>Eſtienne Lanne</hi> are alſo Famous, who made the Coin under <hi>Henry</hi> the II, and thoſe fine Teſtoons of that Prince.</p>
                  <p>As to the Medals of <hi>Henry</hi> the IVth, the fineſt are thoſe of . . . . . . <hi>du Pres,</hi> who was an ingenious Graver, and excellent Sculptor; the Baſs Relief which is to be ſeen in the King of <hi>Sicily</hi>'s Street in <hi>Paris</hi> is a Proof of this. Graving has been always very much Eſteemed, and gain'd a great deal of Credit, as well as the other Arts of Deſigning; the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Commodus</hi> beſides Deſigning which he learnt, learnt alſo to Grave, as we have ſhew'd in the beginning of the <hi>Second</hi> Book: And we can't but believe, that his End therein was to make Medals, the Knowledge whereof has always been ſo much Eſteemed both among the Ancients and Moderns; and that which farther proves this, is, that we find no other ways of Graving among the Ancients, than that of Graving very deep for making Medals, and Graving fine Stones for Rings, and others for Seals, which are often to be met with in the Cabinets of the Curious.</p>
