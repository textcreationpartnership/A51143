            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>OF all the Products of human Wit, whereof the Brain a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the Hand is capable, there are none ≈øo admirable and excellent, as the Arts which relate to De≈øigning.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> were of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. They placed them among the Liberal Arts, and ≈øet ≈øo great a value on them, that their Slaves were forbidden to learn either Painting, Sculpture, or Architecture. There were only Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen permitted the Honour to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe them: And even Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves gloried in the Practice of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> who endeavoured to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Grecians</hi> in the Perfection of
<pb facs="tcp:55267:4"/>the≈øe Arts, had the ≈øame E≈øteem for them; for ≈øeveral Con≈øuls and Emperors took plea≈øure in employing them≈øelves therein. And the≈øe Arts kept up their Excellency, while the Empire was in its heighth; but they began to decline when that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Prey of ≈øeveral Tyrants who were the Cau≈øe of its Ruine. Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture underwent the like De≈øtiny, for they lo≈øt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and E≈øteem they found under the fir≈øt Emperors, and at length fell into that ill and rude Manner, which has been ≈øince named Gothick or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous. But afterwards they regain'd new life and vigour under the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ≈øeveral Princes, and Republicks, and by the Indu≈øtry and Application of tho≈øe ingenious Men who ≈øtudied them.</p>
            <p>It has not been without ju≈øt Rea≈øons that the≈øe Three illu≈øtrious Profe≈ø≈øions have always been valued and e≈øteemed at ≈øo high a rate, for their Beauties are always extremely plea≈øing to the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb facs="tcp:55267:4"/>and there is nothing which more illu≈øtrates the Glory of Princes, than the Productions of De≈øigning. In ≈øhort, the famous Structures of the <hi>Egyptians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> eternize the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of tho≈øe Illu≈øtrious Per≈øons for who≈øe Glory they were rai≈øed: They are al≈øo inconte≈øtable Witne≈ø≈øes of the Victories which their Great Captains obtain'd over other Nations.</p>
            <p>Such clear evidences are more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick than any Hi≈øtories, for they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to us without any prejudice the Truth of tho≈øe Things, for which tho≈øe ancient Buildings were rai≈øed by the Art of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigning: It was moreover by means of this Art that Medals were made, which ≈øerve to confirm ≈øome very doubtful Matters of Fact related by Hi≈øtory: And expre≈øs to us the Actions of Heroes, and tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Memory to Po≈øterity.</p>
            <p>To the≈øe advantages may be added that of Military Architecture, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its Principles from this Art, and which is very nece≈ø≈øary for the Security
<pb facs="tcp:55267:5"/>of Towns, and Defence of Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Nor have the Arts of De≈øigning been of le≈øs advantage to Princes in the Point of Religion, than for the Defence of their States. The Heathens were very Curious in, and made it a con≈øiderable Part of, their Religious Wor≈øhip to di≈øtingui≈øh the Forms they made their Temples of, according to the different Divinities they therein wor≈øhipp'd. Since that time ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of tho≈øe Temples have been made u≈øe of
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">At <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øeveral of the Popes by permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the Emperors of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> converted ≈øeveral of the Heathen Temples into Chri≈øtian Churches, as that of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> which is now the Church of <hi>Notre-Dame de la Rotonde,</hi> and that of <hi>Romulus</hi> was dedicated to St. <hi>Co≈ømus</hi> and St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian;</hi> and al≈øo that of <hi>Bacchus</hi> which is at pre≈øent called St. <hi>E≈øtienne</hi> the round.</note> for the Wor≈øhip of the true God. But tho≈øe that have been built on purpo≈øe for the Chri≈øtian Religion ≈øurpa≈øs tho≈øe ancient Temples: And this may be ≈øeen in ≈øeveral Places, and
<pb facs="tcp:55267:5"/>chiefly in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, at <hi>Rome,</hi> the noble≈øt Church that was ever ≈øeen.</p>
            <p>The Churches are adorn'd with Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, with Ba≈øs Reliefs, and Pictures to repre≈øent the My≈øteries of our Religion, and the Martyrdoms of the Saints.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Subjects managed by ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Painters, and Sculptors, make greater and more la≈øting Impre≈ø≈øions upon the Minds of People, than Words can. This was the Opinion of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and ≈øeveral other Great Men, who were ≈øen≈øibly touched at the ≈øight of the≈øe Repre≈øentations.</p>
            <p>Moreover Nature, which con≈øtantly tends towards what is mo≈øt agreeable to its ≈øelf, taught Men De≈øigning before they had found out Characters to Write. This Truth is evident in the Hi≈øtorical Figures (or Hieroglyphicks) of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Engraven on Stone, as may be ≈øeen on their Obelisks. For tho≈øe Sorts of Letters are only the De≈øigns of Figures made of ≈øome Parts of the Human Body, of Animals, of Plants,
<pb facs="tcp:55267:6"/>and of all ≈øorts of In≈øtruments, which were called Hieroglyphicks, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this People made u≈øe before they had Letters.</p>

There Youth is taught to De≈øign after Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, There are al≈øo taught the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Proportions, Geometry, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpective, and Anatomy: And every Month there are Conferences upon
<pb facs="tcp:55267:8"/>whatever relates to the In≈øtruction of their Di≈øciples.</p>
            <p>Among the Lectures which I have had the Honour to read there, upon the Concours, or Out-lines of Bodies; upon Per≈øpective, Anatomy, and the Motions of the Mu≈øcles: And al≈øo on the Progre≈øs, Fall and Re-e≈øtabli≈øhment of the Arts of De≈øigning, I have cho≈øe the≈øe latter Conferences to Form out of them the Hi≈øtory of the Arts which relate thereunto.</p>
            <p>In the Fir≈øt Book, I treat of the Original and Progre≈øs of Architecture, Sculpture and Painting, from the Fir≈øt Ages of the World, till after the time of the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> when the≈øe Arts began to decline. Throughout all this Tract of Time we take notice of the Curio≈øity of the Kings of <hi>A≈ø≈øyria, Egypt, Phoenicia, Per≈øia</hi> and <hi>I≈ørael</hi> to rai≈øe huge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Buildings. We there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark how the≈øe Arts went from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> to the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55267:8"/>And how afterwards they went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Progre≈øs they made in <hi>Tu≈øcany,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Times of their Kings, of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and of the Emperors; <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> we ≈øhew in what E≈øteem they were there, and how far Protected till their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</p>
            <p>In the Second Book, we treat of their Fall, and ≈øhew how the true Manner and Gu≈øt of De≈øigning began to decline at <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Commodus</hi> down to <hi>Con≈øtantine;</hi> and afterwards, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture al≈øo decay'd: In≈øomuch that an ill and rude Manner was introduced in Building, in Painting and Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Zeal of the Chri≈øtian Religion contributed very much to the De≈øtruction of the ancient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Images, as did al≈øo the taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Reigns of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> who followed that rude Manner in <hi>Italy,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated it almo≈øt throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55267:9"/>
            <p>But the Magnificence of Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was maintained longer in the <hi>Ea≈øtern</hi> Empire than in other Places, and e≈øpecially at <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> by rea≈øon that the Fir≈øt Emperors were very much addicted to Architecture, as we ≈øee in <hi>Con≈øtantius, Theodo≈øius,</hi> and in <hi>Ju≈øtinian,</hi> who Employed va≈øt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures in Building, which for ≈øome time kept up Architecture, Sculpture and Painting: The≈øe two la≈øt ≈øuffered very much, ≈øince the time of tho≈øe Princes, by the <hi>Iconocla≈øtes,</hi> who de≈øtroy'd the Images, and barbarou≈øly per≈øecuted the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and at length the≈øe Arts fell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in that Empire, in the Reigns of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who ≈øuffer none to De≈øign the human Figure, nor any thing that has life.</p>
            <p>In the Third Book, we ≈øhew that about the Year 1110, the Arts of De≈øigning began to revive a little at <hi>Florence,</hi> and in ≈øome other Cities of <hi>Italy;</hi> the Protection they afterwards found under the Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:55267:9"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> the Republicks of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> the great Dukes of <hi>Tu≈øcany,</hi> and the Popes of that Illu≈øtrious Hou≈øe, and ≈øeveral other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> gave means and opportunity to ≈øeveral excellent <hi>Genius's</hi> to apply them≈øelves with a great deal of Zeal to the Re-e≈øtabli≈øhment of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. In fine in the Year 1500 I conclude the Re-e≈øtabli≈øhment of the≈øe Arts, for it was in this happy Century that they were brought to Perfection by the Famous De≈øigners who flouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about that time.</p>
            <p>This has been acknowledged by all the Famous De≈øigners of our Age: Who have e≈øteemed it their Glory to Imitate the Works of <hi>Raphael, Correggio, Julio Romano,</hi> and <hi>Titian,</hi> and ≈øeveral other Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men of the la≈øt Age.</p>
            <p>For it has been by means of this imitation that the true Way
<pb facs="tcp:55267:10"/>of Painting and De≈øigning has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued down to us; as al≈øo the right Manner of Sculpture and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture: As has been practi≈øed from the beginning of this Century 1600. by the Famous <hi>Carraches,</hi> and afterwards by their Di≈øciples <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menichino, Albani, Guido, Lanfranc, Algradi.</hi> Afterwards the true Way and Manner was continued in the≈øe Three Arts at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Pou≈ø≈øin, Francis du Que≈ønoy, Peter da Cortona</hi> and <hi>Bernini.</hi> As al≈øo in <hi>Flanders</hi> by <hi>Rubens</hi> and <hi>Van Dyck:</hi> Moreover <hi>France</hi> by <hi>de Bro≈ø≈øe, Le Mercier, Le Sueur, Sarrazin, Man≈øard, Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Le Brun Mignard,</hi> and ≈øeveral other great Men who have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed in the Arts of De≈øigning.</p>
            <p>But this true and regular Manner is kept up very ≈øucce≈øsfully at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent by tho≈øe Ingenious Men who compo≈øe the Royal Academies of
<pb facs="tcp:55267:10"/>Painting, Sculpture and Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Having determin'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Foot≈øteps of the Ingenious Ancients, and the incomparable Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of tho≈øe excellent Genius's who appear'd with ≈øo much Glory in the Age before them. We may perhaps hereafter pre≈øent the Reader with a Continuation of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory throughout the Century 1600, which we re≈øerve for a Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
            <p>Nor ought it to ≈øurprize any, That a Painter ≈øhould undertake to write an Hi≈øtory of De≈øigning, becau≈øe among other Accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he ought to be Ma≈øter of, that of being well ver≈øed in Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is none of the lea≈øt; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes his Works conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Truth, and can give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of his Repre≈øentations: And joining the Theory of his Art with the Practice, he becomes expert
<pb facs="tcp:55267:11"/>enough to compo≈øe a Sy≈øtem of the Rules of it, far better than tho≈øe who are not De≈øigners.</p>
            <p>This was practi≈øed by the mo≈øt Famous Painters of Antiquity, as <hi>Apelles,</hi> and his Di≈øciple <hi>Per≈øeus,</hi> and
<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>A≈øclepiodorus, Protogenes, Euphranor,</hi> and <hi>Praxiteles</hi> writ of Painting and Sculpture, as did <hi>Argellius</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> of Architecture.</note> others: The Illu≈øtrious Moderns have al≈øo written of the Arts of De≈øigning, as <hi>Leon Bapti≈øta Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> and ≈øeveral others

            <p>The rea≈øon why we have rather given this Treati≈øe the Title of <hi>the Arts that relate to De≈øigning</hi> than the Hi≈øtory of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, is becau≈øe De≈øigning not only comprehends tho≈øe Three Parts, but al≈øo graving on Copper, cutting in Wood, and graving for Medals, and Damask-work, and Embroidery, and Inlaying and ≈øeveral other Works all depending on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigning.</p>
            <p>For this Rea≈øon all the≈øe Arts are put together, and compo≈øe tho≈øe Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies, which are called in <hi>Italy,</hi> Academies of De≈øigning, where Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Sculptors and Architects take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ≈øucce≈ø≈øively the fir≈øt Places: And for this Rea≈øon they who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:55267:12"/>for any of the≈øe Profe≈ø≈øions, fir≈øt of all learn De≈øigning, and then determine their Choice to ≈øome one in Particular, or ≈øometimes to more, being capable of ≈øucceeding therein, if they are fir≈øt of all good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigners.</p>
            <p>This has been evident heretofore in <hi>Daedalus, Phidias Euphranor,</hi> and ≈øeveral others, who were as Excellent in Sculpture and Painting as in Architecture, and al≈øo of late in <hi>Ghiberto</hi> who was a Painter, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, Sculptor and Gold≈ømith: <hi>Verochio</hi> and <hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> were al≈øo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of all the≈øe Arts, as likewi≈øe <hi>Bramante, Raphael, Julio Romano, Balda≈ø≈øare, Vignola</hi> and <hi>Pirro Ligorio</hi> who were Painters and Architects: <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> was equally Excellent in Architecture, Sculpture and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for he was an Excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigner.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55267:12"/>
            <p>Hence it is, we have taken our Device on the Fronti≈øpeice of this Book, which expre≈ø≈øes, that <hi>De≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Parent of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.</hi> And now we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but expect that Criticks will be making Reflections on the Style we have u≈øed throughout this Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But that the Reader may not ≈øtick or carp if he meets with any ob≈øolete Terms or Words not much in u≈øe, and if the Turn of the Phra≈øe is not always ≈øo Nice as he might expect: He mu≈øt know, that the Author's De≈øign is only to make him≈øelf under≈øtood by tho≈øe who learn De≈øigning. Wherefore he hopes that the unprejudiced Reader will not ≈øo nicely regard the Politene≈øs of Expre≈ø≈øion, ≈øince his Bu≈øine≈øs is Painting, and he looks upon the re≈øt only as accidental Accompli≈øhments.</p>
            <p>If this Hi≈øtory find a favourable Acceptance, we de≈øign hereafter to
<pb facs="tcp:55267:13"/>give an Alphabetical Explication of the Terms mo≈øt u≈øed in the Arts of De≈øigning, whence ≈øeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations may be rai≈øed very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for the In≈øtruction of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Lovers of the≈øe Arts.</p>

                  <p>It was no fault of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> that the Arts began to decline after his Reign; for he took particular care to Educate his Son <hi>Commodus</hi> therein, making him learn to

                  <p>THAT which contributed to the de≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Art of De≈øigning at <hi>Rome,</hi> was the removal of <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> to e≈øtabli≈øh the Empire at <hi>Bizantium:</hi> For he hired the be≈øt Arti≈øts in <hi>Rome,</hi> and carried away an infinite number of

                  <p>By what has been ≈øaid in this Book, we may conclude, that the Arts of De≈øign decay'd as ≈øoon as the Princes of the latter Empire grew out of love with them, and no longer protected them: This Neglect of them began the Ruine of the≈øe Arts, which encrea≈øed during the Civil Wars, by the ≈øackings of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the de≈øolation of the Provinces of its Empire. The Infidels and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55267:57"/>the Hereticks contributed much to this Misfortune in ≈øeveral Places, and that even to the total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of the≈øe illu≈øtrious Profe≈ø≈øions.</p>
                  <p>But that the Reflections we make on the Fall of the≈øe Arts may be u≈øeful to tho≈øe who learn De≈øigning, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in con≈øi≈øts the ill and rude Way which was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the time of their Declen≈øion, that it may be avoided for the Future.</p>
                  <p>It may be remarked in the fir≈øt Place in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Pieces, that what they had of Rude or Ill in them, proceeded from the Ignorance of tho≈øe that made them, in the ju≈øt Proportions of the human Figure, which is the ≈øolid Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ju≈øt De≈øigning; ≈øince all their Statues are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate. For the mo≈øt Part have their Heads either too great or too little, the Hands and the extreme Parts too thin and ≈ølender, their Po≈øtures without any choicene≈øs, nay without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or expre≈ø≈øion. Al≈øo in the cloathing of their Figures, are to be ≈øeen Cloaths cut in Pleats and Folds where naturally there are none; in ≈øhort, their Works have nothing that can plea≈øe the View or de≈øerve the Attention of tho≈øe that are Curious.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe are faults which ought to be avoided, as wrong Principles, by the Pupils of De≈øigning: Who ought to apply them≈øelves immediately to the ju≈øt Proportions of the Antients, for therein con≈øi≈øt the true Beauties of the Art.</p>
                  <p>They ought to begin with the Studies of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and Per≈øpective, and with the Po≈øtures which naturally expre≈øs the different Actions of the Body, and Pa≈ø≈øions of the Soul. They ought to take care to learn Anatomy, that they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55267:58"/>may know the Motions of the Mu≈øcles, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve their ju≈øt Contor≈øions.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe are the means which ought to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to arrive to the Knowledge of the true Beauty and Excellency of the≈øe Arts: It has been hereby, that the excellent Modern Painters, and Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Architects have made ≈øuch advances, to whom we are obliged for the Re-e≈øtabli≈øhment of Painting, of Sculpture, and of Architecture: Which ≈øhall be the Subject of the Third BOOK of this Hi≈øtory.</p>

                  <p>AFTER having ≈øhewed in the Second Book of this Hi≈øtory, the cau≈øes of the declen≈øion and fall of Painting, and Sculpture, and Architecture, by the ill and rude Methods, and decay from that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence which they had arrived to among the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> we will ≈øhew in this Third Book how the≈øe Arts by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle emerged from the rude <hi>Gothick</hi> way, and continued their Re-e≈øtabli≈øhment from the year 1013, to the end of 1500; wherein they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to their primitive Perfection, and pa≈ø≈øed from <hi>Italy</hi> into ≈øeveral other Parts, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into <hi>France,</hi> by the ≈øingular Favour they found under our Kings, <hi>Francis</hi> the Fir≈øt, <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55267:59"/>the Fourth, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, who now e≈øteems it as a part of his Glory to have made the Arts of De≈øign to Flouri≈øh.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe Arts of De≈øigning began fir≈øt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in <hi>To≈øcany,</hi> before they were known in other Countries. For as the <hi>Tu≈øcans</hi> were the fir≈øt among the Ancients who practi≈øed them, ≈øo they had the advantage of being the fir≈øt in <hi>Italy</hi> who rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed them from the low ≈øtate to which they were fallen. Thus in the year 1300 there began to appear at <hi>Florence</hi> a better ≈øort of Architecture than the ancient <hi>Gothick;</hi> for in the Church of St. <hi>Miniate,</hi> Built in that time, Architecture may be ob≈øerved to creep out of its barbarous Methods, and to Imitate in all the parts of that Building, the way of the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>After this happy beginning, the Arts of De≈øigning continued on to their Perfection in <hi>To≈øcany;</hi> and the <hi>Pi≈øans</hi> in the year 1016 Founded their great Church, called the Dome of <hi>Pi≈øa:</hi> The Commerce they had by Sea, and particularly into <hi>Greece,</hi> was a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means for the Re-e≈øtabli≈øhment of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture and Sculpture, for they brought thence ≈øeveral Columns and Fragments of ancient Architecture of Marble, which they made u≈øe of in the Fabrick of this Church.</p>
                  <p>They brought together by the≈øe means ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Engravers in <hi>Italy,</hi> and al≈øo <hi>Grecian</hi> Painters, who Work'd after their own old Methods; for only u≈øing in their Painting ≈øimple Lines, which they Coloured all over equally without any Shadowing, their Works
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55267:59"/>were not very Artificial; notwith≈øtanding the≈øe Remainders of Art taught the <hi>Italians</hi> the practice of Painting in Water-Colours, in <hi>Fre≈øco,</hi> and <hi>Mo≈øaick.</hi>

                           <hi>Donato,</hi> called <hi>Donatello,</hi> was born at <hi>Florence</hi> in the Year 1403; he was much addicted to the Art of De≈øigning; he was not only an excellent Sculptor but al≈øo practi≈øed Plai≈øtery and was very learned in Per≈øpective and Architecture; he made ≈øeveral Pieces, and Figures in Marble at <hi>Florence,</hi> and other Cities; he lived to be above eighty Years old, and was very liberal towards his Pupils, in≈øomuch, that he always kept a Bag of Mony fa≈øtned to his Scaffold whereon he taught, for every one of them to take what he had occa≈øion for. One of his be≈øt Pupils was <hi>Bertoldo</hi> and <hi>Michellozzo-Michellozzi</hi> who was al≈øo an excellent Architect, and much in Favour with the <hi>Count de Medicis.</hi>

                        <p>A little before <hi>Donatello</hi> died at <hi>Florence, Jacopo dalla Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> began to leave the old Way, and to practi≈øe the True.

                  <p>He gave to this Art the Perfection, and fine Air of the Antients, above any one who did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him.</p>
                  <p>This is evident by his excellent Statue of St. <hi>George,</hi> the Beauty whereof is de≈øcribed at large by <hi>Francis Bochi.</hi>

                     <hi>Ser-Brunele≈øchi,</hi> Friend of <hi>Donatello</hi> was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Gold≈ømith, Sculptor and Architect, and revived the true and antient Way by the indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Care he took, by going to <hi>Rome,</hi> to di≈øcover the true Rules of the antient Architecture, which yet adorn that City, and ≈øtir up the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Intelligent beholders. This ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man particularly there ≈øtudied the admirable Structure of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> whence he received a great deal of light, for building the Great Church of St. <hi>Mary del Fiore,</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> which all the De≈øigners and Architects were almo≈øt in de≈øpair of ever fini≈øhing, which notwith≈øtanding <hi>Brane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øchi</hi> happily brought to Perfection by means of his Study and Pains.</p>

                  <p>But as <hi>Verrocchio</hi> ≈øtudied every Thing belonging to De≈øigning, he would al≈øo needs practi≈øe Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ≈øame Ardor as Sculpture, for which rea≈øon he left off working at that, and ≈øet him≈øelf to Painting, and brought up therein ≈øeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pupils; among the re≈øt <hi>Peter Perdugino</hi> and <hi>Leonardo da Vinci.</hi> This la≈øt from his Youth began to ≈øurpa≈øs his Ma≈øter. <hi>Verrocchio</hi> ≈øeeing this, left off his Pencil, and betook him≈øelf again to Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; his la≈øt Piece was that Famous Figure in Bra≈øs on Hor≈øe-back of <hi>Bartholomew Cogleone da Bergamuos,</hi> which is to be ≈øeen in <hi>Venice</hi> in the Square of St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

                        <p>One of the greate≈øt Genius's in Painting of the Age, 1400. was <hi>Dominick Ghirlandaio,</hi> of whom we have made mention in the Fourth Chapter, which is evident by the great number of his Excellent Works. Nature gave him a very great Inclination for Painting, which was the rea≈øon he left off from his Youth following the Trade of a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ømith, wherein his Father had Educated him; he was the fir≈øt who invented that Dre≈øs which the <hi>Florentine</hi>-Maids wear on their Heads, called <hi>Ghirlande;</hi> whence he was named <hi>Dominick Ghirlandaio.</hi> As he ≈øucceeded in the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Painting, he imitated in his Colours the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gold, which till that time were done with real Gold. The Reputation of <hi>Dominick</hi> got to <hi>Rome,</hi> where Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth ≈øent for him to Paint in his Chappel; at his Return to <hi>Florence,</hi> he painted the Chappel of <hi>Ricci,</hi> which was one of the chief Pieces; he was u≈øed to ≈øay that De≈øigning was true Painting, and that <hi>Mo≈øaick</hi> was the mo≈øt durable; he dy'd at 44 Years of Age, in the Year 1493. His Di≈øciples were <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Benedict Chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landaio, Seba≈øtian Maimardi, Michael-Angelo Buonarotti,</hi> and ≈øeveral other Ingenious <hi>Florentine</hi>-Ma≈øters.</p>

                        <p>There appeared al≈øo at <hi>Florence</hi> about this time, <hi>Philip Lippia,</hi> Painter, who fir≈øt taught to Paint varieties of Cloathing in his Figures, and therein imitated the Ancients; he had a great Genius in Ornaments and Grote≈øque, he wrought al≈øo in Plai≈øter; and died at 45 Years of Age. Moreover <hi>Luke Signorelli</hi> of <hi>Cortone,</hi> got Reputation by his Painting in that City, and in <hi>Arezzo;</hi> he had a fertil Invention, and a great deal of Grace in Compo≈øing his Hi≈øtories, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned very well <hi>Naked-Figures.</hi>

                  <p>Among the re≈øt, the Illu≈øtrious <hi>Leonard da Vinci</hi> became a great Ma≈øter therein; for from his Birth he had all the Advantages of Nature, which procured him an ea≈øy Entrance into all the Arts that depend on De≈øigning, and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Mu≈øick, and Poetry, wherein he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>

The Author of the <hi>Di≈øcour≈øes on the Lives,</hi> and the Works of the mo≈øt Excellent Painters, is al≈øo of this Sentiment; but in treating of this Science, he explains him≈øelf in very confu≈øed terms, for he mi≈øtakes the Tendons for the Nerves; for in writing of the Statue of <hi>Laocoon,</hi> in a Conference, in the Academy, he expre≈ø≈øes him≈øelf thus, ≈øaying, <hi>The Nerves and Mu≈øcles form the chief Appearances of that Statue.</hi> And in his Book of <hi>Di≈øcour≈øes,</hi> ≈øpeaking of the Mu≈øcles, he teaches in Page 315. of P. T. <hi>That there mu≈øt be had a ≈øpecial regard to the Mu≈øcles and Nerves:</hi> And in Page 556. he ≈øays, <hi>That their Motions depend on the Fabrick of the Bones, and Situation of the Mu≈øcles and Tendons, which ≈øu≈øtain them, and cau≈øe their Action.</hi> In another place he ≈øays, <hi>As the Mu≈øcles and Nerves are more ≈øupple and pliant; which cau≈øes an Alteration in the Nerves,</hi> &amp;c. It will not be ami≈øs, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this for the ≈øake of young Beginners. To do this, you are to con≈øider Three Parts in each Mu≈øcle; the Head, the Belly, and the Tail, which are only their Beginning, Middle, and End; this end of the Mu≈øcle, is that which is called the <hi>Tendon,</hi> re≈øembling Cords, which the Author of the <hi>Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes</hi> calls <hi>Nerves,</hi> at the Feet of <hi>Laocoon;</hi> where it is evident, that they are the <hi>Tendons</hi> of the long and ≈øhort <hi>Enten≈øors</hi> of the Fingers, which end at the Articulations of each of them, being there very vi≈øible, by rea≈øon of the dolorous Motions, which <hi>Age≈øander,</hi> the Sculptor, ≈øhews this Figure to have made at the biting of ≈øeveral Serpents. As to what this Author ≈øays, That <hi>the Tendons ≈øu≈øtain the Mu≈øcles, and cau≈øe them to Act;</hi> this is to ≈øpeak without any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding in <hi>Anatomy</hi> or <hi>De≈øign;</hi> he might have ≈øaid, That the Tendons end the Mu≈øcles, but not that they cau≈øe their Motion. For the Animal Spirits give Motion to the Mu≈øcles, which are communicated to them by the Nerves, which are their Vehicle; but the≈øe Nerves are diffu≈øed, and lo≈øe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves among the Membranes, and Fle≈øh, by ≈ømall <hi>Ramuli</hi> or Branches, which end like Hairs; ≈øo that they cannot be ≈øeen without the Skin; on the contrary, they are the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons that are there ≈øeen, which indeed the Ancient Language calls Nerves, when Anatomy was not arrived to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as now-a-days. This appears in an old Tran≈ølation of the Bible, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.25. where the Angel after having wre≈øtled all Night with <hi>Jacob,</hi> not being able to overcome him, touched him on the Nerve of the Thigh, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately it dry'd and wither'd, and he became Lame (this Nerve is properly the Tendon of the Mu≈øcle, called the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi> of the Thigh). In Memory of this Action, the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> did not Eat in Animals this part, like the Tendon, which was withered in <hi>Jacob</hi> by the touch of the Angel of the Lord. <hi>Idem, Ver.</hi> 32. which evidentlv proves, that it is not only the Nerve, but the Tendon which makes part of the Mu≈øcle.</note> and the Motion of the Mu≈øcles, by the Studies which he made under <hi>Mark Anthony de la Tour,</hi> Profe≈ø≈øor in that Science.</p>

                  <p>But as <hi>Leonardo</hi> was always meditating on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Things, for the Glory of the Prince whom he ≈øerved, he made a Model in Earth of a Figure on Hor≈øeback, of a remarkable heigth, and ≈øingular Beauty, with a de≈øign to Ca≈øt it in Bra≈øs; but that was not done, whether for the difficulty of Founding ≈øo great a Work, or for ≈øome other Rea≈øon; and this fine Model was ruined when the <hi>French</hi> conquered the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øe.</hi>

                  <p>This rare Per≈øon had a very happy Genius, and from his Infancy a great Inclination for Painting: He learn'd the Principles from his Father, in the City of <hi>Urbin,</hi> which was his Native Country: But his Father ≈øeeing that from his Youth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, put him to <hi>Peter Perugino</hi> one of the mo≈øt renowned Painters of <hi>Florence:</hi> Whom <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> in a ≈øhort time ≈øo well imitated, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Work of this Di≈øciple ≈øurpa≈ø≈øed that of his Ma≈øter. After <hi>Raphael</hi> had left <hi>Perugino,</hi> he travelled to <hi>Siena,</hi> where he heard of the great E≈øteem that was made at <hi>Florence,</hi> of a Piece whereon was de≈øigned a Battel which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Leonard da Vinci</hi> made for the Council Hall. He under≈øtood al≈øo that there was another Piece of De≈øigning very much admired, which <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> had done in the ≈øame Hall, where <hi>Leonard</hi> and <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> had painted each one half. This obliged <hi>Raphael</hi> to leave his Work to go to <hi>Florence</hi> to ≈øee the≈øe two Famous Pieces: Which he had no ≈øooner ≈øeen, but he bethought him≈øelf that he mu≈øt ≈øtudy hard to acquire tho≈øe Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in De≈øigning, wherein he then acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him≈øelf inferiour to tho≈øe two Ingenious Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>Thus he ≈øtudied very hard to acquire the true Idea of tho≈øe fine Airs of the Head, that round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, force and perfection of the Works of <hi>Leonard:</hi> he al≈øo ob≈øerved the Beautiful outlines of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Figures, in the De≈øigns of <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> and that that Beauty and Correctne≈øs proceeded from the true Proportion, and natural Situation of the Mu≈øcles, and the ju≈øt ob≈øervation of their Motions; <hi>Raphael</hi> that he might acquire this Knowledge, ≈øet him≈øelf diligently to ≈øtudy Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and his whole De≈øign was to quit the

Several Pictures which are at <hi>Florence</hi> and at <hi>Lucca,</hi> in the Churches of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and St. <hi>Romanus</hi> are illu≈øtrious Proofs it: They appear to this Day as fre≈øh as if they were newly painted: For be≈øides the Beauty of their De≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had a very fine Colour, and a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Relief cau≈øed by a ju≈øt di≈øtribution of Light and a grand Force of Shadow, with an admirable Union and Perfection.</p>
                  <p>The Beauty of the≈øe excellent Pieces very much charmed <hi>Raphael</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and obliged him to contract an intimate Friend≈øhip with <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> from whom he learn'd with a great deal of Care
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55267:78"/>and Advantage the way of Painting and Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Friend≈øhip of <hi>Raphael</hi> was al≈øo no ways di≈øadvantageous to <hi>Fr√† Bartholomew,</hi> for <hi>Raphael</hi> communicated to him the Rules of Per≈øpective, which he was not before ≈øo well acquainted with as he.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Raphael Sanzio,</hi> joining to the Gifts Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had favoured him with, all the care and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Studies that were nece≈ø≈øary, formed that fine Method of his, which ≈øhines through all his rich and judicious Compo≈øitions. His Po≈øtures are ea≈øy, natural and lively in each Expre≈ø≈øion, his Proportions elegant and taken from the fine Figures of the Antients, all the Airs of his Faces ≈øo noble that they ≈øeemed to have ≈øomething of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in them; in ≈øhort, he fini≈øh'd all the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Figures with the utmo≈øt Perfection, and had the truly fine Way of cloathing them; the≈øe are tho≈øe excellent Parts of the Art which make his Pictures the mo≈øt perfect among the Moderns, which this great Painter has made appear in the Palace of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> in all the Halls, and all the Lodges which he painted.</p>
                  <p>This is particularly to be ≈øeen in his Piece of the Transfiguration at St. <hi>Peters,</hi> in <hi>Montorio,</hi> which has always been e≈øteemed as one of the chief Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Painting, and be≈øt Pictures in the World. Tho≈øe al≈øo which <hi>Francis</hi> the I. cau≈øed him to make in Oyl, and which are carefully pre≈øerved in the Cabinet of the King, ≈øufficiently te≈øtify this Truth.</p>
                  <p>This Piece of the Transfiguration was al≈øo the chief Ornament of his Funeral Pomp, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled the publick Sorrow, when they ≈øaw that admirable Picture, near the Body of that rare Per≈øon, and that Death had ≈øo ≈øoon deprived that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55267:78"/>Excellent Painter of Life, who will always live in the memory of the Lovers of this Art.</p>
                  <p>By this it is ea≈øy to judge that <hi>Raphael,</hi> was the mo≈øt excellent Genius in this ART, of the la≈øt Age, and that he carried it to its highe≈øt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

<note n="(b)" place="bottom">The Reflexions of Objects from poli≈øh'd and ≈øhining Bodies, as well as from Diaphanous ones, like the Water, are very agreeable in Pictures, when made by the Rules of Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as is done by the Illu≈øtrious <hi>Pou≈ø≈øin,</hi> who in that as well as ≈øome other Parts of Painting has exceeded all other Painters.

                        <p>The Merit of <hi>Titian</hi> was ≈øo much valued by <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Vth,</hi> that he honoured him with the Dignity of a Knight and Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and gave him ≈øeveral Marks of his E≈øteem; One day as the Emperor was ≈øeeing him Paint, <hi>Titian</hi> let fall his Pencil, the Emperor immediately took it up, ≈øaying, that <hi>Titian</hi> de≈øerved to be ≈øerved by <hi>Cae≈øar;</hi> and the Grandees of the Court being jealous of the Honours the Emperor heaped on him, the Emperor ≈øaid He could every Day make Great Men, as they were, but he could not make a <hi>Titian.</hi> As often as he painted this Great Prince, he received a Pre≈øent of a thou≈øand Growns of Gold. Among the re≈øt of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> who≈øe Portraits he drew, he did that of <hi>Francis</hi> the I≈øt, which is ≈øtill in the Cabinet of the King at <hi>Ver≈øailles,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very lively.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Titian</hi> moreover began the De≈øigns of ≈øeveral Pieces in <hi>Mo≈øaick</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which were fini≈øhed by <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Vincent Zuccheri,</hi> the be≈øt Arti≈øts of tho≈øe Times. <hi>Titian</hi> dyed of the Plague in the Year 1576, Aged 99 Years.</p>
                        <p>Several Painters endeavoured to follow the Manner of Colouring of <hi>Titian;</hi> but he had but few Di≈øciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he did not care to take the Pains of In≈øtructing them: Among tho≈øe he did Teach, the mo≈øt Ingenious were <hi>John de Calker,</hi> who lived not long, and dyed at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and <hi>Paris Bordone</hi> of <hi>Trevi≈øano,</hi> who imitated <hi>Titian</hi> the be≈øt of any.

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ≈øame Curio≈øity was in all the Courts of</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>and chiefly in that of</hi> Mantua.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BY the Examples of all tho≈øe great Men we have but now mentioned, it is evident, that this Curio≈øity had got among the Great Princes of the la≈øt Age, who gave Proofs even to Emulation of their endeavours to Revive the Arts of De≈øigning. Thus Painting and Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture made great Progre≈ø≈øes by the Protection they found from the Princes, and the Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tho≈øe Excellent Per≈øons who Cultivated them.</p>
                  <p>At this time the≈øe Arts continued to flouri≈øh at <hi>Mantua;</hi> for after De≈øigning had begun to be e≈øtabli≈øhed there by the Curio≈øity of tho≈øe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øs's and Dukes, who employ'd <hi>Leon Bapti≈øta Alberti Co≈øta,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Mantegna,</hi> the famous <hi>Julio Romano</hi> made that City very fine.</p>
                  <p>Thus, when this Illu≈øtrious De≈øigner had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh'd Painting <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi>'s Hall at <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Raphael,</hi> his Ma≈øter, was to have done; <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> went thither, where he was ≈øo charm'd with <hi>Julio,</hi> that he oblig'd him to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and come to <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He there immediately ordered him to Build the Palace of <hi>T.</hi> whereof he afterwards painted all the Apartments; and it was in the≈øe Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Works, that he ≈øhew'd the Greatne≈øs and Vivacity of his Genius; there is to be ≈øeen on the four ≈øides of the Hall, which is painted in Fre≈øco, the Overthrow of the Giants; and on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55267:84"/>the Cieling, <hi>Jupiter</hi> darting his Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts; as al≈øo all the re≈øt of the Gods amazed at their Boldne≈øs. <hi>Julio,</hi> moreover, painted the <hi>Loggia</hi> or Gallery of this Palace, where are the Hi≈øtories of <hi>David;</hi> and al≈øo Embelli≈øh'd the Great Hall with the Fables of <hi>P≈øyche</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> He adorn'd ≈øeveral other Apartments with Pictures and Stucco-work, which were all very admirable.</p>
                  <p>He painted, moreover, ≈øeveral Battels out of <hi>Homer's Iliads</hi> in the Palace of St. <hi>Seba≈øtian,</hi> and made fine Pieces of Tapi≈øtry for the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which repre≈øented the Combats and Triumph of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> whereof the King, the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Modena;</hi> have each a Suit of Hangings, very richly high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd with Gold
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">The≈øe Tapi≈øtries were made in <hi>Flanders</hi> by <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>John Bapti≈øta Roux,</hi> very ingenious Workmen.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But as his Genius was univer≈øal, and he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all the Parts of De≈øigning; Architecture, which is one of them, took up mo≈øt of his time at <hi>Mantua;</hi> for be≈øides the Palace of <hi>T.</hi> which he Built, he made the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and ≈øeveral others of a very regular Architecture. It was he al≈øo who found the way of pre≈øerving that Noble City from the Inundations of Water of the <hi>Lake,</hi> which runs round it; he Built there ≈øeveral Magnificent Palaces, and cau≈øed the great Streets to be enlarged, which are very beautiful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Julio Romano</hi> gained ≈øo much here by the E≈øteem of the Duke, and of the Cardinal his Brother, that he u≈øed to ≈øay, this Painter was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55267:84"/>more Ma≈øter of <hi>Mantua</hi> than he him≈øelf. Thus the E≈øteem and Honour he received of the≈øe two Princes, engaged him to ≈øtay there, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Rome,</hi> although the Pope de≈øired it, to make him chief Architect of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church

                        <p>At <hi>Cremona,</hi> near <hi>Mantua,</hi> Painting began to flouri≈øh ever ≈øince <hi>Pordenone</hi> made there ≈øome Pieces in Fre≈øco, and in Oyl, which ≈øhew'd the true Gu≈øto of Painting to <hi>Camillo,</hi> Son of <hi>Boccacino,</hi> to <hi>Bernard da Gatti,</hi> called <hi>Soardo,</hi> who work'd at <hi>Panna,</hi> and to <hi>Galeazzo Campo,</hi> who had three Sons Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Julius, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Vincent.

                        <p>In Sculpture, as well as Painting, there have been Women very famous, particularly <hi>Porperzia de' Ro≈ø≈øi</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi> who was very much admired in that City for her Painting, and by the Works ≈øhe made in Marble; ≈øhe died in the time that <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth came to <hi>Bologna</hi> to Crown <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth.

                           <hi>Milan</hi> al≈øo brought up ≈øome very good Painters, one of the mo≈øt Ancient of whom, is <hi>Bramantine,</hi> who work'd for Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Vth. in the <hi>Vatican;</hi> but his Painting was taken down, and <hi>Raphael</hi> has ≈øince painted the ≈øame place.

                        <hi>Architecture arrived to a very great Excellency at</hi> Rome.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE famous <hi>Ser-Brunele≈øchi</hi> began to bring Architecture out of the rude <hi>Gothick</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which had been practi≈øed at <hi>Florence,</hi> and other places, down to 1400. For he e≈øtabli≈øhed in that City the u≈øe of the <hi>Dorick, Ionick,</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Orders, in all their Purity, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tho≈øe ju≈øt Rules he had ≈øtudied at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Ancient Buildings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leon Bapti≈øta Alberti</hi> followed the Foot≈øteps of this Illu≈øtrious Architect and Sculptor, and in Imitation of him continued at <hi>Florence</hi> the true Gu≈øto of Architecture, by rea≈øon that he was an excellent Geometrician and good De≈øigner. His Treati≈øe of the Orders, and his Works of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, are a proof of it.</p>
                  <p>The famous <hi>Bramante,</hi> by his Excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, continued to improve the latter part of this Age, as <hi>Brunele≈øchi</hi> and <hi>Leon Bapti≈øta</hi> had done; and al≈øo the beginning of the Age, 1500. wherin he lived. <hi>Bramante</hi> learnt Painting from his Youth, and gained his Livelihood thereby for a long time, in the State of <hi>Urbin,</hi> (where he was Born) and in ≈øeveral Cities of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where he made ≈øeveral Pictures. But as he had al≈øo a Genius for very great things, he went to <hi>Milan</hi> to con≈øider the Building of the great Church there, then under the Conduct and Management of <hi>Cae≈øarianus,</hi> a very Ingenious Architect; and <hi>Bernardino da Trevio,</hi> a <hi>Milane≈øe,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55267:86"/>al≈øo a good Painter, and Architect, and Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer, who was very much e≈øteem'd by <hi>Leonardo Vinci,</hi> though his way of Painting was ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dry.</p>
                  <p>The Reflections which <hi>Bramante</hi> made on this famous Church, together with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he gained by tho≈øe two Architects, who were the Managers and De≈øigners of it, made him have a mind to apply him≈øelf wholly to the Study of Architecture; whereupon he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where having kept together what he had gotten by Painting, he ≈øurvey'd with a particular Care and Curio≈øity the magnificent Ancient Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that City, tho≈øe of <hi>Tivoli</hi> and of <hi>La Villa Adriana;</hi> his Affection to Architecture led him al≈øo to <hi>Naples,</hi> to ob≈øerve all the fine Remainders of Antiquity which are there and thereabouts. He there met with the Protection of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Archbi≈øhop, who had ≈øuch an E≈øteem for him, that a little after he Engaged him to make at <hi>Rome</hi> the Cloy≈øter of the Church of Peace. Afterwards he was employed by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VIth. and he ≈øhew'd his Skill in the Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Palace of the Chancery, and of the Church of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> in <hi>Dama≈øo.</hi> He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli≈øh'd, moreover, ≈øeveral Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> by Fronti≈øpieces of his own De≈øigning; that of St. <hi>James</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of St. <hi>Mary del l'Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and of St. <hi>Mary del Popolo,</hi> are convincing proofs of it; as al≈øo the little Temple of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, which is con≈øecrated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Mont-Orio:</hi> The≈øe Works and ≈øeveral others gain'd him ≈øo much reputation, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowledged the be≈øt Architect of his time; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomuch, that in 1503. <hi>Julius</hi> the Second being Pope took him into his Service, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

                  <p>GOOD Architecture began to revive in the Provinces of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true Gu≈øto of the Ancients, for there were ≈øeveral Illu≈øtrious Architects who came from <hi>Verona,</hi> who were happy in being Born in a City where there were ≈øo many Relicks of fine Architecture: For it is mo≈øt certain that the be≈øt Precepts which can be given in the Arts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigning, are fine Examples, whereon Youth Ca≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Eyes and Thoughts with a particular Inclination for De≈øigning, cannot but ≈øucceed: And this is an Advantage which the <hi>Italians</hi> have had above other Nations, who have render'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves famous in Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting; in≈øomuch, that it is not a wonder that in the la≈øt Age they have ≈øurpa≈ø≈øed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Tho≈øe Ingenious <hi>Verone≈øe</hi> Architects, were <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, Michael San Michael,</hi> and <hi>John Maria Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conetti. Joconde</hi> was called Fryer <hi>John Joconde,</hi> ever ≈øince he wore the Habit of the <hi>Dominicans;</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:55267:88"/>and though his fir≈øt Talents were Learning and Theology, he was notwith≈øtanding an excellent Architect, and learned in Per≈øpective; for from his Youth he exerci≈øed him≈øelf in the true anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way of Architecture, by his Studies after the Theaters, Amphitheaters, Triumphal-Arches, and other Relicks of Ancient Buildings, which make <hi>Verona</hi> famous.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Joconde</hi> ≈øet him≈øelf to practi≈øe this Art, he was immediately very much favoured by <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who gave him Orders to rebuild at <hi>Verona</hi> the Bridge, which is called the Stone-Bridge, and which is very con≈øiderable, by rea≈øon of the Rapidity of the River, and its moving Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. <hi>Joconde</hi> from his Youth had ≈øtudied the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities at <hi>Rome,</hi> and even the very In≈øcriptions, whereof he compo≈øed a very fine Book, which was pre≈øented to the old Duke <hi>Laurence de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> He al≈øo made Notes on <hi>Cae≈øar</hi>'s Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and de≈øign'd the De≈øcription of the Bridge, which that Emperor made over the <hi>Rhine.</hi> After this <hi>Joconde</hi> was ≈øent for from <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, for whom he rai≈øed ≈øeveral Buildings; the mo≈øt famous were the Bridges of <hi>Notre Dame</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> which this Prince order'd him to make, on the Building whereof <hi>Sannazar,</hi> his Friend, made this Epigram,</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Joconde</hi> at his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Death of <hi>Bramante,</hi> was made one of the Surveyors of the Fabrick of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with <hi>Raphael d'Urbin,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Sangallo. Joconde</hi> al≈øo made at <hi>Venice</hi> ≈øome ≈øurprizing Works, for he found out the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55267:88"/>Invention of turning away part of the Waters of the <hi>Brinte,</hi> that they ≈øhould not fill the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Shores of that City with Sand and Earth, which that River brought down along with it, and by the≈øe means he pre≈øerv'd <hi>Venice</hi> from the Accidents which threatned it. <hi>Budaeus</hi> ≈øays in Honour of this Great Man, that he return'd Thanks to God that he had ≈øo good a Ma≈øter in Architecture, as <hi>Joconde,</hi> who exceeded <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael San Michel,</hi> ≈øtudied the Principles of Architecture at <hi>Verona,</hi> under his Father and Uncle, who were very good Architects; but at Sixteen Years of Age he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there mea≈øured the fine Ancient Buildings round about it, and thereby became skilled in every part of Architecture, in≈øomuch that Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> VIIth. gave him a Pen≈øion to go with <hi>Sangallo,</hi> and Fortify the Frontiers of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øtick State, particularly <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia.</hi> Afterwards he returned to <hi>Verona,</hi> who≈øe fine Gates he made, and the Republick employ'd him in the Principal Buildings of the State, in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and on the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> among which may be reckoned the Fortre≈øs of <hi>Lido.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>John Maria Falconetti,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo of <hi>Verona,</hi> was a very famous Architect: He learnt Painting of his Father; but becau≈øe he did not get much by it, he ≈øet him≈øelf to Study the Antiquities of the City; after which he went to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> to Survey the Buildings of the Ancients, where he employ'd him≈øelf for the ≈øpace of twelve Years, and omitted nothing in his De≈øigns, neither there, nor in the Parts round about. But as he had not ≈øufficient Means to continue his Studies long, he employ'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55267:89"/>him≈øelf ≈øome Days in the Week in Painting, thereby to ≈øupply his Nece≈ø≈øities.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards returning to <hi>Verona,</hi> and finding there no opportunity of employing him≈øelf in Architecture, he found him≈øelf obliged to take up Painting again; but through good luck he found in that City <hi>Signior Cornaro,</hi> who was a great lover of Architecture, who cau≈øed him to come to his Hou≈øe, where he dwelt twenty one Years; he employ'd him≈øelf all this while in Working, and exerci≈øing that Art, which <hi>Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netti</hi> had ≈øo much ≈øtudied. Thus the≈øe three Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrious Architects of <hi>Verona</hi> introduced the true Gu≈øto and Way of Building into the <hi>Venetian</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>This true and regular Way of Building was continued there, and even augmented by <hi>James San≈øovino,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who embelli≈øh'd <hi>Venice</hi> with the greate≈øt and mo≈øt regular Buildings that are there to be ≈øeen.</p>
                  <p>The famous <hi>San≈øovino</hi> began from his Youth to ≈øtudy De≈øigning and Sculpture at <hi>Florence,</hi> which he very ≈øucce≈øsfully practi≈øed; he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a great Re≈øpect for <hi>Andrew del Sarto,</hi> an Excellent Painter. After this he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he got acquainted with <hi>Raphael</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi> who did him Ju≈øtice in their Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of his Skill to <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> had at that time great Inclinations to build them≈øelves National Churches at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> al≈øo obtain'd the ≈øame favour from the Pope.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Florentines</hi> cau≈øed ≈øeveral Models to be made by <hi>Raphael, Balda≈ø≈øare, Anthony Sangallo,</hi> and <hi>San≈øovino.</hi> It was the De≈øign of this la≈øt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55267:89"/>that they cho≈øe: And <hi>San≈øovino</hi> began to build the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> for the <hi>Florentines</hi> according to the Model he had made of it. But this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was di≈øcontiuned during the Popedom of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> the VIth, a Fleming by his Countrey, who had no affection nor gu≈øt for the Arts of De≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In≈øomuch, that if he had reigned long the≈øe Arts would have infallibly ≈øunk into their old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcurity, at lea≈øt at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth ≈øucceeded him, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this misfortune; for he ≈øet to Work all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious in the≈øe Arts: And <hi>James San≈øovino</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by the≈øe means the Fabrick of the Church of the <hi>Florentines</hi> till the Year 1527, wherein the Army of <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth be≈øieged <hi>Rome,</hi> which cha≈øed away from that City a great Number of excellent Men. <hi>San≈øovino</hi>

                     <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> was born at <hi>Florence</hi> in 1474, with a natural Inclination for De≈øigning; for although in his Youth he was brought up to Learning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding he bu≈øied him≈øelf always in private about De≈øigning: And as his Father ≈øaw that he had a very great Inclination for Painting, he put him to <hi>Dominick Ghirlandaio,</hi> for him to in≈øtruct him therein; and in a little time <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> di≈øtingui≈øh'd him≈øelf from other Di≈øciples, by the ≈øurprizing Facility wherewith he de≈øigned: This great Genius was very fortunately favoured by Prince <hi>Laurence de Medicis,</hi> by rea≈øon of the great Pa≈ø≈øion this Prince had to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Revival of the Arts, by a≈ø≈øi≈øting Men skilled and learned therein. This generous Temper made him e≈øtabli≈øh in the Gallery of his Gardens an Academy which he fill'd with fine Pictures and Pieces of Sculpture both Ancient and Modern. Afterwards he cau≈øed to be ≈øought out at <hi>Florence</hi> tho≈øe Young De≈øigners who promi≈øed mo≈øt, to whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd Pen≈øions to promote the conveniency of their Studies. Tho≈øe of the School of <hi>Ghirlandaio</hi> were cho≈øen the fir≈øt, and particularly <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> who had ≈øo lively a Genius for all the Parts of De≈øigning, that one day having taken up a piece of Marble, he ≈øet about making a Head, tho' as yet he had never handled a Chi≈øel; which ≈øo much ≈øurprized Prince <hi>Laurence,</hi> that he conceived ≈øo great an Affection for <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi> that be≈øides the Pen≈øion he allow'd him, he did him the Honour to admit him to his own Table, and gave him a Lodging in his Palace. After the Death of this Prince, his Succe≈ø≈øor <hi>Peter de Medicis,</hi> continued to <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> the ≈øame Affection he had been favoured with by the Great Duke his Father.</p>

                     <hi>Signor Soderini Gonfaloniere</hi> of the ≈øame Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, had no le≈øs e≈øteem for this ingenious Man than the≈øe two Princes; and about the ≈øame time <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> made a <hi>Cupid</hi> of Marble which was ≈øent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and hidden under Ground, to pretend that it was an Ancient one: It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dug up and ≈øold for ≈øuch to Cardinal St. <hi>George,</hi> and this <hi>Cupid</hi> pa≈ø≈øed for one of the mo≈øt rare and fine Pieces of Antiquity. Hereby this famous Sculptor acquired a great Reputation at <hi>Rome;</hi> whither he went for the fir≈øt time: He continued Sculpture there with a great Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made a <hi>Bacchus</hi> of Marble with ≈øeveral other admirable Statues. At his return to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> he apply'd him≈øelf with the ≈øame diligence to that fine Art, and made a Marble <hi>David,</hi> which was ≈øet up before the Palace. <hi>Peter Soderini,</hi> and all the Citizens were ≈øo charmed with this Piece, that they obliged this famous De≈øigner to make ≈øome more of them, ≈øome in Bra≈øs and others in Painting. Then <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> ordered him to Paint one half of the Council Hall, and <hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> the other.</p>
                  <p>It was here that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> made a Piece to Parallel that of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci</hi> which was ≈øo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in this Work gave proofs of the Excellence of his De≈øigning, both in re≈øpect of the compo≈øition of the Subject, which was the War of <hi>Pi≈øa,</hi> and in his correctne≈øs in naked Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: And to have an opportunity of ≈øhewing it the better, he cho≈øe the time when ≈øeveral of the Soldiers u≈øed to bath them≈øelves in the River <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> to introduce into his De≈øigning naked Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, in which he was Excellent; it was this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Piece that gave <hi>Raphael</hi> and ≈øeveral others an in≈øight to the Perfection of De≈øigning.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The working of this <hi>Mau≈øoleum</hi> was for a long time interrupted, becau≈øe the Pope ≈øet <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to Paint in Fre≈øco the arched Ceiling of the Chappel of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the IVth, which ≈øo much rai≈øed his Reputation, that be≈øides the general Applau≈øe he received at <hi>Rome,</hi> he received con≈øiderable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents from Pope <hi>Julius:</hi> He de≈øerved both the one and the other; for he alone painted that Vault af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øo admirable a way, that the famous <hi>Caraches,</hi> who came after him, took thence their magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ideas in the Painting of the Palace of <hi>Farne≈øe</hi> at <hi>Rome.

                  <p>After this in the Popedom of <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth, he made in the Ve≈øtry of the ≈øame Church, the Sepulcher of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher even till this time has pa≈ø≈øed for a wonder both of Architecture and Sculpture.</p>

                  <p>This excellent Per≈øon moreover ≈øhewed that he was Ignorant in nothing in all the Arts of De≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for he al≈øo fortified the Mount St. <hi>Miniate</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and thereby hindered their Enemies from becoming Ma≈øters of it.</p>
                  <p>But when the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> in 1525 obliged ≈øeveral ingenious Arti≈øts to leave <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Florence, Michael Angelo</hi> was one of that Number, and went to <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Doge <hi>Gritti,</hi> to whom he had the honour to be known, cau≈øed him to make the De≈øign of the Bridge of <hi>Realto,</hi> which is one of the Ma≈øterpieces of Architecture. He painted in that City ≈øome Pictures, and among others that of <hi>Leda,</hi> which he gave to the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> who ≈øent it to <hi>Francis</hi> the I≈øt.</p>
                  <p>The Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> being ended, <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there fini≈øhed the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of <hi>Julius</hi> the IId, after which he painted by order of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the IIId the great Front of the Altar, whereon he repre≈øented the la≈øt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it was this only which was not fini≈øhed of all the Paintings of this Chappel. The Fame of this great Work in Fre≈øco, which is all over the World, ≈øufficiently denotes its Excellence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in his old Age apply'd him≈øelf more to Architecture than Painting and Sculpture, becau≈øe after the death of <hi>Antony Sangallo</hi> Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, the Pope preferr'd <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to any other, and made him chief Architect of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the Apo≈øtolick Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although he would have excu≈øed him≈øelf from it.</p>
                  <p>Having accepted this Charge he went to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, to ≈øee the Model of <hi>Sangallo,</hi> to fini≈øh what remain'd to be built of that great Church, and after having examined it, he publickly declared
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55267:92"/>that that Architect had made the Model of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Art, becau≈øe without ≈øide he had made too many Pillars, one upon another, and unnce≈ø≈øary Spires, and too many ≈ømall Branchings and little Members, which are quite contrary to good Architecture; <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> that this Model was of a Gu≈øto rather Barbarous than Ancient: Be≈øides this he ≈øhew'd that the execution or performance of it would co≈øt a Million more than one that he would make.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> cau≈øed another Model to be made in fifteen days time which co≈øt only five hundred Crowns, whereas that of <hi>Sangallo</hi> co≈øt four thou≈øand, and ≈øeveral Years work; ≈øo that at la≈øt this great Church was fini≈øhed according to the De≈øign of <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in the beauty we ≈øee it now, excepting the Front, which is not his, nor ≈øo well done as the Architecture of the outermo≈øt Tower and the back Part of that Church. While <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> carried on this Building, he al≈øo made ≈øeveral others which make part of the beauty of <hi>Rome:</hi> Such as the Palace of <hi>Farne≈øe,</hi> and the Capitol, which excite the Admiration both of Architects and other Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men.</p>

                     <hi>Tintoret,</hi> continued to embelli≈øh the Palaces and Churches of that City and of the <hi>Venetian</hi> State with a great Number of excellent Pieces: In≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the≈øe Pieces both then and ≈øtill cau≈øe admiration in the Curious, and ≈øerve for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Study to young Painters, who love this fine Way of Painting and Colouring. For it may be ≈øaid in Prai≈øe of the≈øe two excellent Per≈øons, that they were tho≈øe who brought Colouring at <hi>Venice</hi> to its highe≈øt Perfection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jerom Mutiano</hi> of <hi>Bre≈øcia,</hi> was al≈øo of this State and learnt the Principles of Painting: Afterwards he perfected him≈øelf at <hi>Venice</hi> by the Pieces of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> where he learn'd the true Way of Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drawing Landskips, wherein he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. After this he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he continued to Study his Art with ≈øo much Ardor, that to beat Love out of his Head, which he found ≈øomewhat to hinder him, he cut off his Hair, and never ≈øtirr'd from home, till his Picture of the Re≈øurrection of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was done, and his Hair grown again. This Work, which is to be ≈øeen at St. <hi>Mary Majore,</hi> was very much prai≈øed by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Angelo,</hi> and acquired a very great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Painter who made it, as did al≈øo that which he painted in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, which repre≈øents the Vi≈øit of St. <hi>Antony</hi> to St. <hi>Paul</hi> the fir≈øt Hermit.</p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:55267:100"/>
                  <p>He work'd for the Cardinal <hi>d'E≈øte,</hi> who had a very great E≈øteem for him; he made ≈øeveral other Pictures at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Orvieta</hi> and at <hi>Loretto.</hi> Among the other good Qualities of <hi>Mutiano,</hi> he had an extraordinary Way of teaching Youth, and by his Will he left two Hou≈øes to the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and al≈øo ≈øomething to build A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments for the Students of De≈øigning who were Poor; it was he who by his Credit with Pope <hi>Gregrory</hi> the XIIIth, obtained a Brief of him to found that Academy, and who cau≈øed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moli≈øh'd Church of St. <hi>Luke</hi> on the Mount <hi>E≈øqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino</hi> to be changed into that of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> which ≈øtood at the Foot of the Capitol, and which has been ≈øince rebuilt, and embelli≈øh'd according to the De≈øigning of <hi>Pietro da Cortona</hi> a famous Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this Age.</p>
                  <p>Architecture, which had been brought to a very high Degree of Perfection at <hi>Venice,</hi> by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Architects we have mentioned, was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there after the true and fine Way of the Antients, by <hi>Daniel Barbaro, Scammozzi,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Palladio,</hi> who excell'd the others, as the fine Churches he built at <hi>Venice</hi> ≈øufficiently te≈øtify; as al≈øo the Palaces and Seats of Plea≈øure and other Buildings he made in the <hi>Venetian</hi> State; which are all of a true and fine Way. This, together with the ingenious Books of the Orders of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, and of the Temples of the Ancients which are extant of his, are as ≈øo many perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Monuments of the Merits of <hi>Palladio.</hi>

                  <p>Painting was al≈øo one of his Employments at <hi>Rome.</hi> He there painted ≈øeveral things in the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Mercy,</hi> as al≈øo the Front of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Teodoli,</hi> and another Front of a Palace in <hi>Campo

                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Pirro Ligorio</hi> apply'd him≈øelf entirely to Architecture, and his great Capacity procured him to be Architect of the Pope, and of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, under the Popes <hi>Paul</hi> the IIId, <hi>Paul</hi> the IVth and <hi>Pius</hi> the IVth.

                  <p>This great Man <hi>James Barozzi da Vignola</hi> went when he was Young to <hi>Bologna</hi> there to learn Painting, but finding that for want of Means and In≈øtruction, he did not much profit therein; he re≈øolved to ≈øet him≈øelf wholly to ≈øtudy Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, for his inclination led him mo≈øt that Way: He had al≈øo a particular Fancy for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpective, wherein he found out by his Study tho≈øe fine Rules he publi≈øhed.</p>
                  <p>But as he knew, that to become an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Architect, it was not enough to ≈øtudy <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius,</hi> and to fill him≈øelf with Ideas of ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fine Sciences, but that the Study al≈øo of the antient Buildings was ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary thereunto, ≈øo he re≈øolved to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to de≈øign them. In the mean time his Skill in Painting was a great help to him; For at

                  <p>This Academy was compo≈øed of ≈øeveral inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Men, one whereof was <hi>Marcello Cervino,</hi> who was afterwards Pope.

The Fame of <hi>Vignola</hi>'s Capacity and the Reputation he had got, were the Rea≈øon that in 1537 <hi>Francis Primaticcio,</hi> ≈øent to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Francis</hi> the I≈øt, gave him a Commi≈ø≈øion to mould and form ≈øome of the fine≈øt ancient Figures: And afterwards he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into <hi>France,</hi> where he work'd for that King, in making ≈øeveral De≈øigns for Buildings, which were but in part fini≈øhed by rea≈øon of the Wars.

                  <p>At the ≈øame time Sculpture flouri≈øh'd in the Low Countries as well as Painting, for tho≈øe two Noble Exerci≈øes are Originated from the ≈øame Principle, which is De≈øigning: For this rea≈øon there were bred in that Country excellent Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Antwerp, John de Dales, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cucur</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>James Bru≈øca,</hi> all Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Architects. <hi>Bru≈øca</hi> made ≈øeveral Pieces for the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and he brought up <hi>John Bologna</hi> of <hi>Douay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was this Famous <hi>John Bologna,</hi> who gain'd the mo≈øt Honour of any to his Nation for Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the Beauty which appear'd in all his Works, which have all of them the true Way and Gu≈øt of the Ancients, wherein he perfected him≈øelf in <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Florence,</hi> where he re≈øided, and held the fir≈øt Place in that Art.

                  <p>This has been, and is ≈øtill ≈øeen in <hi>France,</hi> and other Places, that the fine Books of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture have made a great many Good Architects; who without going to <hi>Italy,</hi> where are the fine Relicks of Antiquity, have formed a true and good Manner, and perfected their Studies in this Art by the Help of Graving, which faithfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents the Plans, Profils, the Elevations and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures of the fine≈øt Buildings.</p>
                  <p>Painting has al≈øo the ≈øame Advantage by Prints as Architecture, and has given that way ≈øolid In≈øtructions to ≈øeveral Painters. This may
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55267:108"/>be remarked by the Prints of <hi>Mark Antonio</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the De≈øigns of <hi>Raphael,</hi> which have taught the true manner of De≈øigning to ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral very con≈øiderable Painters.</p>
                  <p>The Illu≈øtrious <hi>Pou≈ø≈øin</hi> is an Example of this, in the great Application he made in his Youth to De≈øign by tho≈øe Prints when he was at <hi>Paris.</hi> It was here this Great Painter ≈øo happily imitated the manner of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and the Ancients, in his admirable Works.</p>
                  <p>The Sculptors moreover received the ≈øame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from Graving as the Painters, for that made the De≈øigns of the fine Figures of the Ancients familiar to them, and all the fine <hi>Ba≈øs Reliefs</hi> of the Famous Columns and Triumphal Arches, which are to be ≈øeen in the Palaces and Hou≈øes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Graving was found out at <hi>Florence</hi> by <hi>Ma≈øo Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerra</hi> a Gold≈ømith, who printed all that he grav'd on Silver: Afterwards <hi>Baccio Bandinelli,</hi> who was a <hi>Florentine</hi> Gold≈ømith, continued that Art, but as he was no good De≈øigner, he copied the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns of <hi>Sandro Boticelli</hi> of that City. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Graving, being then come to the knowledge of <hi>Andrew Mantegna,</hi> an Excellent Painter, who was about that time at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was ≈øo much enamour'd with it, that he ≈øet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to learn it, and he graved <hi>Bacchanalians</hi> with the Burin, and a great Triumph he cut in Wood, which was very Admirable. This Art went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from <hi>Italy</hi> into the Low Countries: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> of <hi>Antwerp</hi> who was a Painter, practi≈øed it, and ≈øent a great many of his Plates into <hi>Italy,</hi> and continued to make them better and better.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Antwerp, Albert Durer,</hi> in the ≈øame City began to Grave after a better Manner, De≈øign and Compo≈øition; for he endeavour'd more
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55267:109"/>nearly to follow Nature, and approach the <hi>Italian</hi> way, which he always e≈øteemed the be≈øt: About the Year 1503, he made a ≈ømall Statue of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which ≈øurpa≈ø≈øed the Works of <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> and he continued to make ≈øeveral Plates of Hor≈øes, de≈øign'd according to Nature, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there of the Prodigal Son.</p>
                  <p>But when he had graved ≈øeveral of the≈øe Plates with the Burin, and ≈øaw, that they took up a great deal of Time, he ≈øet him≈øelf to Grave on Wood, that he might publi≈øh a greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Works, and in the Year 1510 he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed of that Sort of Graving the beheading of St. <hi>John,</hi> the Pa≈ø≈øion of our Lord, and ≈øeveral other Pieces which went quickly off. <hi>Albert,</hi> by the e≈øteem People ≈øet on his Works, became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rich; and this engaged him to Grave again with the Burin, and he made a Piece repre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Melancholy, three Notre Dames, with the Pa≈ø≈øion of our Lord in thirty ≈øix Pieces.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Francis Francia</hi> was e≈øteemed at <hi>Bologna</hi> of the fir≈øt rank of Painters; he had ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Di≈øciples, whereof <hi>Mark-Antonio Raimondi</hi> was the be≈øt, by rea≈øon of his Capacity in De≈øigning, which gave him a great Facility in handling the Burin in Gold≈ømiths Works, in which he was Excellent. But according to a Re≈øolution he took to Travel, he went to <hi>Venice.</hi> There he ≈øaw Stamps which <hi>Albert</hi> had made with the Burin, and in Wood. They ≈øo plea≈øed him that he bought of them as far as his Money would reach; among the re≈øt he had the Pa≈ø≈øion cut in Wood: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reflecting what Honour and Profit he ≈øhould have gotten, if he had employ'd him≈øelf to Grave after that way, he at length determined to ≈øet him≈øelf wholly thereunto, and he ≈øo well copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Pa≈ø≈øion of <hi>Albert</hi>'s on Copper, that it was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55267:109"/>taken to have been done on Wood; he al≈øo put the Mark of <hi>Albert A. D.</hi> thereon, and ≈øo well imitated that Work, that no body took it for <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi>'s but for <hi>Albert</hi>'s, and it was bought and ≈øold for ≈øuch at <hi>Venice;</hi> in≈øomuch that ≈øome Copies were ≈øent to <hi>Albert</hi> of the Pa≈ø≈øion that <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> had done, which made <hi>Albert</hi> ≈øo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry, that he went from <hi>Antwerp</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> to complain to the Republick of the Wrongs <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> had done him: But he could obtain nothing thereby, but only that his Mark ≈øhould be no more put to <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi>'s Pieces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Albert</hi> at his Return to <hi>Antwerp</hi> found a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, <hi>Lucas van Leyden,</hi> who
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Lucas van Leyden</hi> had an extraordinary Inclination for De≈øigning even in his Childhood; he made Pictures at the Age of twelve Years; he apply'd him≈øelf al≈øo to Graving; at fifteen Years of Age he had grav'd ≈øeveral Copper Plates; he died at thirty nine. Years of Age in 1533. In the time of <hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Albert,</hi> there appeared with a great deal of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Han Holbein</hi> of <hi>Ba≈øil.</hi> He practi≈øed al≈øo Graving; there are of his Hand Wooden Cuts of the Bible, and a Dance of the Dead, which he painted in that City. But his chief Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Painting, which he practi≈øed a long time in <hi>England,</hi> where he was e≈øteemed the mo≈øt Ingenious of his Time; he died at fifty ≈øix Years of Age in 1554.</note> though he was not ≈øo good a De≈øigner as him≈øelf, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding equall'd him in the Beauty of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Burin, as he made it appear in 1509, by two round Prints; the one was Chri≈øt carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cro≈øs, the other his Crucifixion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucas</hi> continued to ≈øhew his Ingenuity, by a <hi>Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion,</hi> which he grav'd in ≈øixteen Pieces, and by his other Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Albert,</hi> at this, grew jealous of <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and becau≈øe he would not be excell'd, he redoubled his Application and Indu≈øtry in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.

                  <p>This may be ≈øeen by his Treati≈øe of the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an human Figure, of Per≈øpective and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture: His Works have made his Name

                        <p>Albert Durer died at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> his own Country, in 1528, at fifty eight Years of Age. This Epitaph is to be read on his Tomb.</p>
                        <q>Quicquid Alberti Dureri mortale fuit, conditur hoc tumulo. Emigravit <hi>VIII</hi> Idus Aprilis, <hi>1528.</hi>

                     </note> Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrious, for they contributed to the Re-e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment of the Arts in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and al≈øo in <hi>Italy;</hi> for they were the Prints of <hi>Albert</hi> which engaged <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> to follow Graving, and made him Grave ≈øo happily the Works of <hi>Raphael,</hi> that are ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to all De≈øigners.</p>
                  <p>Thus by the Opportunity <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> had of Copying at <hi>Venice</hi> the Prints of <hi>Albert,</hi> he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a facility and readine≈øs in Graving, and went afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the fir≈øt Thing he grav'd was a <hi>Lucretia,</hi> after <hi>Raphael:</hi> This was ≈øhewn to this great Painter, who at the ≈øame time contracted a Friend≈øhip with <hi>Mark-Anthonio,</hi> and ≈øet him to Grave a Plate of the Judgment of <hi>Paris,</hi> another of the Death of the Innocents, and ≈øeveral others.</p>
                  <p>This was very Advantageous to <hi>Raphael,</hi> and gained him, as well as <hi>Mark-Antonio,</hi> a great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> and created an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation among ≈øeveral De≈øigners, who apply'd them≈øelves to Graving, and became Di≈øciples of <hi>Mark-Antonio.</hi>

                  <p>But about this time happened the ≈øacking and taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> which reduced <hi>Mark-Antonio</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt to Beggary.

                  <p>About this time was found out the way of Graving in Wood with Chiaro-≈øcuro, which make the Prints appear as if they were height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with White by the Pencil; and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon who found out this Invention was <hi>Hugo de Carpi,</hi> an indifferently good Painter, but who had a Genius for ≈øeveral Things.

                  <p>From his Youth he learnt Painting at <hi>Bologna</hi> of <hi>Pro≈øper Fontana,</hi> afterwards he ≈øtudied Graving and Architecture under <hi>Dominick Tibaldi.</hi> In a ≈øhort time he exceeded his Ma≈øter, who got con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderably by the Ingenuity of his Di≈øciple. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øtin</hi> had al≈øo a great Love for Sculpture, which made him work in <hi>Relievo</hi> under <hi>Alexander Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganti</hi> a <hi>Bolonian.</hi> Notwith≈øtanding which he did not leave off Graving, for he had a general Genius, which led him to Learning, to Geometry, and all its dependencies.</p>
                  <p>He went afterwards with his Brother, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Hannibal Carrache</hi> to ≈øtudy Painting in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> and to learn the charming fine Manner of

He moreover grav'd ≈øeveral Pieces after <hi>Correggio,</hi> after <hi>Baroche,</hi> and made al≈øo ≈øeveral Plates after the Life, of his own Invention, which are all very admirable.</p>
                  <p>It is al≈øo True that toward the End of the la≈øt Age, <hi>Augu≈øtin Carrache</hi> advanced Graving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond tho≈øe who had preceeded him; and that which farther di≈øtingui≈øh'd him from other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, was the excellence and correctne≈øs of his De≈øign. For he had ≈øo pa≈ø≈øionate a De≈øire to make tho≈øe Arts Flouri≈øh, that he with his Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrious Brother <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and their Cou≈øin <hi>Lewis Carrache</hi> e≈øtabli≈øh'd an Academy at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was this Famous School which brought up the mo≈øt Ingenious De≈øigners and Famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Bologna,</hi> who maintained the excellence of De≈øigning and Painting, in the highe≈øt Pitch tho≈øe Noble Arts have arrived to ≈øince their revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. It is to the≈øe <hi>Carraches</hi> we are obliged, for having hindred Painting, at the beginning of our Age, from a total Declen≈øion at <hi>Rome,</hi> which then threatned it, by rea≈øon that the Manneri≈øts of the School of <hi>Jo≈øeph Arpino,</hi> and tho≈øe of the School of <hi>Caravage,</hi> who were their Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goni≈øts, got the better of tho≈øe who followed the Gu≈øto of the Ancients, and the noble Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Raphael.</hi> But at la≈øt the Ingenious Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Academy of the <hi>Carraches,</hi> got the day both from the one and the other, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øtabli≈øhed the true way of De≈øigning and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55267:113"/>which has ever ≈øince happily continued down to us: And throughout all this Age of 1600 the≈øe Arts have appear'd and continued in Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which ≈øhall be the Subject of the <hi>Second</hi> Part of the Hi≈øtory of the≈øe Arts.</p>
                  <p>By the Ingenious Gravers we have mentioned in this la≈øt Chapter, it may be noted that we reckon Graving among the Arts that depend on De≈øigning and Painting, as Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to them, for the Painters fir≈øt began the right Practice of it, and to advance it to that high Degree wherein now we ≈øee it.</p>
                  <p>We may moreover ≈øee that the Way of making the Punchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Dies for ≈øtriking of Medals, is one Sort of Graving, which depends on Sculpture: And that the mo≈øt Excellent Gravers have been all well ver≈øed both in Sculpture and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; for they never Grave their Coins, till they have fir≈øt modell'd their Works: Thus Sculpture preceeds Graving. The ingenious Medalli≈øts in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the IId and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the IVth, were Sculptors; and we commonly hold, that <hi>John Goujon</hi> made the fine≈øt Medals of this fir≈øt King, and of <hi>Catharine de Medicis</hi> which are to be ≈øeen. <hi>John Rondelle</hi> and <hi>E≈øtienne Lanne</hi> are al≈øo Famous, who made the Coin under <hi>Henry</hi> the II, and tho≈øe fine Te≈øtoons of that Prince.</p>
                  <p>As to the Medals of <hi>Henry</hi> the IVth, the fine≈øt are tho≈øe of . . . . . . <hi>du Pres,</hi> who was an ingenious Graver, and excellent Sculptor; the Ba≈øs Relief which is to be ≈øeen in the King of <hi>Sicily</hi>'s Street in <hi>Paris</hi> is a Proof of this. Graving has been always very much E≈øteemed, and gain'd a great deal of Credit, as well as the other Arts of De≈øigning; the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Commodus</hi> be≈øides De≈øigning which he learnt, learnt al≈øo to Grave, as we have ≈øhew'd in the beginning of the <hi>Second</hi> Book: And we can't but believe, that his End therein was to make Medals, the Knowledge whereof has always been ≈øo much E≈øteemed both among the Ancients and Moderns; and that which farther proves this, is, that we find no other ways of Graving among the Ancients, than that of Graving very deep for making Medals, and Graving fine Stones for Rings, and others for Seals, which are often to be met with in the Cabinets of the Curious.</p>
